## **2023** On Lago Maggiore

<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Marlene sat with</span> a large, round hat on the terrace of a vacation apartment on Lake Maggiore, in northern Italy.
She looked over the lake, to the mountains on the opposite side.
The terrace was overgrown with agaves from the left and right, and on the terrace itself, there were pots with large plants everywhere.
She sat in the shade cross-legged on a basket chair, her hands in a meditation gesture, her eyes closed.
After a while, she opened her eyes and put on her headset, put her legs on a small table, took the laptop on her lap, and started typing.

Marlene with half volume in her headset: "Hej!"

She listened.

Marlene: "Everything is very quiet here.
I can work.
The terrace is theoretically visible from the other bank, but that's four and a half kilometers.
It's okay."

She listened.

Marlene: "Yes, of course, I have heard about the new leaks on Google.
I know these two boys personally.
It's really unbelievable: The Android people actually managed to clean the back doors for the third time.
For the third time!
And swore twice before never to do it again.
What are they doing?
They completely lose their credibility.
I know some regular people who are going through the ceiling now."

She listened.

"No, that's bullshit, they didn't find those two.
They're still here and active."

She listened.

"Of course, I'm sure.
I just got a Ricochet message.
They've found others, maybe they need some scapegoats.
Maybe it didn't run quite clean, perhaps they hacked into other accounts internally and sent the leaks out over them.
But definitely, they're still there, not blown out and wildly determined to report new vulnerabilities as long as they're built in."

She listened.

"Yes, that's right.
I agree.
They're heroes.
These are the heroes of modern times.
We need them.
These are the revolutionaries of whom pictures will later be hung on the wall.
First, you want to hang them yourself, later you want to hang their pictures.
Jesus, Gandhi, Martin Luther King, Mandela."

She listened.

"Yeah, yeah, sure.
I don't know what I'd rather be.
I don't want to end up as a picture on any wall either.
But it will be.
People love to admire others.
That's more convenient than doing anything yourself."

Marlene heard a blow against the metal gate at the entrance and turned around in shock.
She looked.

Marlene: "Wait a minute."

She saw Luigi come in with a big bag.

Marlene: "I'll call you back.
See you soon."
She turned around.
"Luigi!
I didn't know you were coming now."

He smiled at her, put the bag on the table, and kissed Marlene on the right and left cheeks.
She smiled and reached for the bag.

Marlene: "Ahhh, Italian cookies!
Mmmhhh.
Benissima."

Luigi was in his mid-thirties and had lived here in Luino, in the Italian part of Lake Maggiore, near the border with Switzerland, for 20 years.
He had created a local hackerspace, not the biggest one, there were only 5 or 6 members, but they had one or two useful hacks behind them.
For example, they had built the coffee machine, which first had to be persuaded by encrypted Jabber chat that you now need coffee.
The coffee machine analyzed how active they were in open source projects on Github.
If it wasn't enough for her, then you had to find one of the tricks to get her to cook.
They presented this two years ago at the Chaos Communication Congress in Berlin.

The request to house Marlene had come from an old friend, and he had immediately agreed: How could he not help the woman who had laid the foundation to repair the Internet from scratch, the woman who had shown them all the potholes in the data highways?

Luigi: "Did you see?
Your class sent you a letter via WikiLeaks."

Marlene: "No.
You did?
My old class?
Now? Now?
What do they write?
That I should come back and face a fair trial?"

Luigi: "No, not at all.
I think what they write is super cool.
They want to strike until your public image is corrected again.
They're on strike against propaganda in Germany."

"What?" Marlene took her legs off the table and started typing something into her laptop.
Then read it.
Luigi stood next to her and put her hand on her shoulder.
He smiled.

Luigi: "It's good to read something like that, isn't it?"

Marlene looked at Luigi briefly from the corner of her eye and continued reading.
After a while, she got up and went to the terrace railing.

"Not there!" Luigi shouted, "not to the railing.
"That's visible."

Marlene stopped.
Tears rolled down her cheeks.
She grabbed the railing with both hands and closed her eyes.
Luigi came and put his arms around her from behind.
So they stood for a few minutes.
Then he gently pulled her back.

Luigi: "Come on! Out of sight."

Marlene detached herself from him and sat back in her basket chair, took the laptop, and reread the letter.

Marlene: "Do you have a piece of paper and a pencil?"

Luigi: "What?"

Marlene: "Paper, pencil, just normal, like in school."

Luigi: "Yes, I think so."
He went away and came back with a pad and a pen.
Marlene put the block on her laptop and started writing:

<div style="background-color: #222; color: lightgreen; padding: 20px; margin: 20px 0; font-family: 'Courier New'">
Dear Sophie, Anni, Kevin, Aischa, Lukas, Janis, Lisa, Leonie, Felix, Berem, Jannik, Jannick, Philip, Moritz, Antonia, Aylin, Johanna, Tom, Jonas, Devin, Marie, Lena, Nils, Marwin, Emilie, Viviane, Tatjana,

I'm sitting here with tears in my eyes because I just read your letter. It's so good to hear from you. I really didn't know if I had lost you or not. And you seem to be the only ones who really know me - except for some hacker friends who stayed with me. Also there some turned away. We have powerful opponents.


Your letter will be noticed by the public. I think you know you're going to get a lot of headwinds. The Internet is full of war, with dead, wounded, prisoners, and tortured people. You've all been under surveillance for two years. All your mobile phones, all your accounts, Facebook, WhatsApp, email, Threema, Telegram, even Signal, and Xabber. This is done by a small program directly on smartphones. On smartphones, nothing is safe if you're under the direct surveillance of a large intelligence agency. And you do. It's best to switch everyone to secure laptops. I'll ask someone to come and help you set up secure communications.


Prepare for headwinds. What you are doing is great, but it is a real danger for some powerful people that they definitely want to eliminate. You are dangerous because you create attention, arouse interest. That's their biggest problem. But you can also be sure that from now on a lot of eyes from the internet will look at you who want to protect you. They will do things that will give you a higher chance to come out safe. Your opponents, our opponents, don't shy away from murder either. Therefore: Go to the public, make noise so that people see you. You need to use TV, the press, Twitter ... They flee from the public in panic, they have a hell of a fear of the anger of ordinary people. That's their real danger. They need average people, they need you because somebody has to do the work, pay taxes and buy things.


I think you have a significant advantage: you will be surprised that a whole class is closed for more publicity, for the truth. That's strong. It will take them a few days or even weeks to learn how to deal with it. This is your chance. Until then, the world must know you. Then you can come through. They will want to separate you, try to make enemies of each other through their parents, siblings, friends, teachers. Don't be afraid and don't let promises give you hope. And use the best weapons there are PGP, Tor, OTR, Tails, Cubes, Pond, Ricochet and Veracrypt. And Linux or BSD of course, just Linux or BSD!


All the best.
I hope to see you again ...


Marlene

Luigi: "Hello!
That reads well!
And you're right.
You're in great danger now.
But we can do that.
I'll take your letter, scan it and send it to WikiLeaks.
Your famous mailbox is working again."

"Can you do it from here?" Marlene asked.
"I don't want the leaf to leave the apartment."

Luigi: "Okay."
He went away and came back with an older digital camera.
He showed it to Marlene.
She nodded.
Then he took a picture of the letter.
Marlene took it, went to the patio fireplace and set it on fire.
Then she went to her laptop, plugged in the camera's SD card, and started typing.
