## **2021** Surprising message

<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Mariane sat alone</span> in front of her laptop, next to her a plate of chicken and rice.
She ate with one hand and typed into her laptop with the other.
She was in a chat with a group of hackers.

Torrorist: "That was a show! Have you read Marlene's logs? Tough thing."

Mohammed: "Yes, especially the QR thing, the idea of creating data with a QR film, that's great.
7 hours 53 minutes would take the TAO computer on which the file is stored to display the terabyte as a QR movie on the screen.
But what do you take for the other side? A good camera, small, with battery, more than 1TB memory, fast enough?"

Thaedaot: "A regular Raspberry Pi is enough.
I'll write you the program to convert the QR film into data in half an hour.
You always have the same perspective on the QR code.
It'll go really fast.
"A USB flash drive with two terabytes in, HD camera, normal battery pack."

Julian: "And put the whole thing in a booklet and put it on the shelf opposite the computer.
There you go.
How do we start the program?"

Marlene: "You have to type PAUL in capital letters on the console."

Julian: "Geil.
Sounds good."

Thaedaot: "I'm building this thing.
Who brings it in and presses the keys?"

For a while, no one in the chat room answered.

Marlene: "Shit! That's not funny."

Julian: "Hej, Marlene, that was super good.
We had fun.
You tried it.
They're scared the shit out of us now, and they got a lot of work to do.
We all need new computers now.
Some people move all the way.
We've lost a lot of entrance doors.
You, above all, put that in the TAO.
But, what the hell.
The hack was awesome.
The idea big."

Mohammed: "A simple traffic barrier.
Pffff."

Torrorist: "Who knows.
Maybe there were more.
But Marlene came out again.
And not one of us got it, not one of us.
That's the very best thing.
But, Marlene, you really have to go where you are.
They're looking for you like crazy."

Mohammed: "Yes, it is.
Here in Dahab, some strange creatures have been buzzing around for two days.
We're watching them.
That doesn't look good.
They've even been to the hotel."

Torrorist: "Where's the turnoff?"

Mohammed: "Yupp."

Julian: "Shit, Marlene, you gotta get out of there right now.
They must be academic people.
I got a tip that two groups were sent to Dahab and Hurghada."

Mohammed: "Okay.
Let's close up here.
See you soon, I'm gone."

Thaedaot: "Marlene! Look in your Pond."

Marlene: "See you soon! I'm so glad you exist."

She clicked the chat window away and changed the Tails identity.
On her screen appeared:

<div style="background-color: #222; color: lightgreen; padding: 20px; margin: 20px 0; font-family: 'Courier New'">
"New message received from Thaedaot."
</div>
She wrote, "show."

<div style="background-color: #222; color: lightgreen; padding: 20px; margin: 20px 0; font-family: 'Courier New'">
I've just been contacted through Jabber. Someone,
who wants to talk to you about Pond. I don't know where they have
my address from. It's a little scary. He's got
a pond-secret for you and said that it would take 30 minutes
is valid. Oh, shit. It could be a trap. Pay attention! He said he knew what happened to Corinne. I don't even know what Corinne he's talking about.

LG, Fred

Pond-Secret: DECD !E02 (0E6 !82C B9E9
</div>
Marlene breathed in.
"Corinne," she thought.
She hadn't heard from her in four months.
Shit.
A honeypot? Especially to attract them? No one knew Corinne in her area.
Not even Marwin.

She closed her eyes.
In 20 minutes, Achmed would come here, and she would disappear from here forever.
He had said that he would take her over to the other side, to Saudi Arabia, that was only 35 km.
Achmed was Bedouin, he had a large family, with many connections, also in Saudi Arabia.
"We'll help each other," he had said, "we've been doing this for centuries."
That was her best option now.
The Saudi Coast Guard was brutal, but it was also slow and not particularly motivated.
Saudi Intelligence? It didn't sound terrifying to her anymore.
20 minutes.
Could she dare?

All her thoughts disappeared and she started typing:

<div style="background-color: #222; color: lightgreen; padding: 20px; margin: 20px 0; font-family: 'Courier New'">
new-contact boatly_unknown_contact DECD !E02 (0E6 !82C B9E9
</div>
With that order, Pond was told to contact someone: You entered a name and a secret.
The other one did exactly the same thing with the same secret.
And when the two secrets met somewhere in the dark part of the Internet, a secure connection was established between the two sides.

<div style="background-color: #222; color: lightgreen; padding: 20px; margin: 20px 0; font-family: 'Courier New'">
Key exchange with boatly_unknown_contact complete.
</div>
"Wow!" Marlene thought.
"That was quick.
Almost a little too fast."

<div style="background-color: #222; color: lightgreen; padding: 20px; margin: 20px 0; font-family: 'Courier New'">
Message received from boatly_unknown_contact.
</div>
Marlene took a stance: "And a message right away.
Someone really wants to talk to me."

Typically, news over Pond took a few minutes.
But it was possible to shorten the time.

She typed "show."

<div style="background-color: #222; color: lightgreen; padding: 20px; margin: 20px 0; font-family: 'Courier New'">
Hello, Marlene,

you don't know me, but I know a lot about
you. Your brother Marwin is in a CIA prison.
Somewhere in the United States. I'm afraid he's not feeling well under the circumstances.
But he is quite good. About you, there are suspicions that
you're in Dahab or Hurghada, and you were three months ago.
Hours into the central database of the TAO.
</div>
Marlene stopped breathing. "Wow." She kept reading.

<div style="background-color: #222; color: lightgreen; padding: 20px; margin: 20px 0; font-family: 'Courier New'">
Corinne's dead. She was in the same prison as
your brother and didn't make it. I don't know exactly how it happened. But they wanted to know things about her boyfriend which she didn't know, couldn't know. I learned this a few days ago. I'm was present at her friend's death. I was sitting in the room when it happened. A blow to the head.
Brutal!

He was lying there. He didn't get up again. I had to get out and throw up when I realized that he was really
was dead. That was a turning point for me. I decide to quit, go out.
But it's not that simple,
where I work. I'm here at TAO headquarters,
in the NSA. I'm a liaison officer with the CIA. I'm in charge
of data that the CIA uses to track down hackers,
to arrest them, question and kill. I have no will
to be a part of this. I've been following your story.
I want to help you.

I'm writing to you now to tell you that the CIA
the mercenary company Academi, formerly called
once Blackwater to catch you or kill you and give them
the two cities of Dahab and Hurghada.

There are at least 20 people in both places right now,
to find you. When you have a chance to get away,
then try it. You are currently searching only there and at the
Places where you have friends and family. If you have any questions,
write. I'm here now.

Greetings, Anita

"reply," typed Marlene:

<div style="background-color: #222; color: lightgreen; padding: 20px; margin: 20px 0; font-family: 'Courier New'">
How do you know I was in the database?
</div>
"Send."

Hardly a minute later:

<div style="background-color: #222; color: lightgreen; padding: 20px; margin: 20px 0; font-family: 'Courier New'">
The order in which you want to save the log files of the twelve computers
was the same as the one you took the first time
you were on a TAO computer a few months ago. And a few other things agreed. We have
Hacker profiles here, they're capturing that.
</div>
Marlene squeezed her chest with her hand.
"Oh, God," she thought, "this can be real." She jumped up.
I went around the table a few times, sat down again.
In such situations, she trusted only her feelings.
After two more minutes she wrote:

<div style="background-color: #222; color: lightgreen; padding: 20px; margin: 20px 0; font-family: 'Courier New'">
Can you buy a current Raspberry PI today?
an HD camera, a 2TB memory stick? And do you have access
to the server room of the 07 machine?
</div>
"Send."

Marlene looked spellbound at the monitor.
Nothing happened.
If Anita asked why she wouldn't answer anymore.
She needs to directly understand that she was serious.
Come right in.
Otherwise, it wouldn't work.
She didn't know about Anita.
Was she a woman or a man?
How old?
Or maybe even a group who were all standing in front of an NSA monitor right now discussing what to write next?

<div style="background-color: #222; color: lightgreen; padding: 20px; margin: 20px 0; font-family: 'Courier New'">
Message received from boatly_unknown_contact.

appeared on the screen.
"show" was typed by Marlene.

<div style="background-color: #222; color: lightgreen; padding: 20px; margin: 20px 0; font-family: 'Courier New'">
Yes.
</div>
Marlene closed her eyes.
It was a risk.
But everything was risky now.
She wrote:

<div style="background-color: #222; color: lightgreen; padding: 20px; margin: 20px 0; font-family: 'Courier New'">
Anita,

you'll get a program in a few hours for the
Raspberry of 5!50 F%87 1(37 AC56 3%EE

All you have to do is copy it to an SD card, and then you can
Raspberry with it. You're not placing it any further than
Three yards from the monitor from the 07 machine. You type P A U L
one. Everything else happens automatically. It'll be about eight hours
take a while. Write to him when you've finished the stick.
</div>
"Send."
She sent the same message to Thaedaot.

"Klonck," the door sounded dull under the water.
Seconds later, Achmed appeared, tore off his diving goggles and shouted: "Quick, Marlene.
They're coming.
Boats and a helicopter."

Marlene looked around.
She put her laptops in the rubber bag and began to put on the diving suit.
"Helicopter," she thought.
"Shit."

"No time.
Just the bottle," Achmed shouted.
She pulled over the oxygen bottle, put on the mask, and tied the suitcase around herself.
Achmed disappeared into the water.
She jumped after him.
Outside the boat, he swam in a different direction than usual.
Marlene followed.
It went deeper, along the trench.
And after about 50 meters Marlene recognized a small submarine on the seabed, which normally brought tourists to dives.
Achmed grabbed a hook and tied it to Marlene's chest belt at the front.
One for yourself, then.
He gave a signal to the submarine driver, and it started.
