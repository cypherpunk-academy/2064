## **2022** And go!  

<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Three weeks later.</span>

Marlene: "It feels good, the new gate.
Also Cubes OS.
So free.
And Tails.
Much less vermin ... madness, what has happened in the last three weeks."

Fred: "You feel that?"

Marlene: "I think so.
Maybe it's imagination, but somehow when I put my fingers over the keyboard - it's different.
It feels fresh.
Yes, definitely, it feels more open."
She giggled.

Fred: "Marlene!" He looked at her with a serious expression.
"Marlene!"

Marlene looked back seriously: "Yes."

Fred: "I think it's time."

Marlene: "Yes, I think so too."

Fred: "And you're sure you're going to do it that way?
I mean, really consistent."

Marlene: "There's no other way.
The coarsest holes in the free programs are stuffed.
The Linuxes and the BSDs run reasonably stable.
All important applications too.
Not perfect, they will still need months for many small things, but it's okay."

Fred: "That's not even five percent of all computers in the world."

Marlene breathed deeply.

Fred: "Microsoft, Apple, and Google didn't answer your questions?"

Marlene: "No, nothing."

Fred: "But they suspect something?"

Marlene: "Sure.
They see what's going on in the Linux field right now.
Besides, they're involved in the development of free software everywhere.
They finance complete projects.
So they also got the documents of the vulnerability database for it.
Only not for their own systems.
And these are huge gaps that are suddenly found everywhere.
Weak points, some of which have been there for twenty years and have been exploited by all kinds of people.
Now they are gone.
And besides, they got our offer to give them their vulnerabilities, if they participate.
They don't want to participate, they don't want to join, but they've probably already put together emergency teams."

Fred: "Yes, that was probably too much for them: to announce all the back doors that they had built into their programs on their behalf or on their own initiative.
And to publish the entire source code of their programs and keep it publicly up-to-date so that everyone can finally see what they are doing.
I guess that was too much.
For sure they've signed that they can't say anything about the backdoors."

Marlene: "They definitely signed that.
But what's the point?
It was just as illegal to install them."

Fred: "Fuck."

Marlene: "Well, let's get it.
How many websites now have the whole terabyte encrypted ready for download?"

Fred: "253."

Marlene: "That's enough.
We also have it on the WikiLeaks website.
Okay, then we'll release the key now.
About Twitter: The Intercept, Chaos Computer Club, netzpolitik.org, Ed Snowden.
WikiLeaks will retweet it anyway.
And all our channels too.
Everyone should pass the key on immediately, download files, decrypt."

Fred looked over his shoulder: "In any good thriller, the moment would be when the door would be kicked in, and a Swat team would come in screaming."
He grinned and listened.
Everything was quiet.
Marlene stood up and closed the window.

Marlene: "There are others who would have the key to such cases."

Fred: "I know it's supposed to be a joke."

Marlene: "Well, I'm pressing ... now! ... away!"

Fred: "Away!"

Marlene: "Away!"
She breathed out and watched her laptop.
"The Intercept has already retweeted it, netzpolitik.org, WikiLeaks too ... Okay.
Then it has the world. Ed Snowden too."
She nodded to Fred, and they both looked at each other in the eye for a long time.

After a while, Fred winked at her: "And now the letter."

Marlene: "Oh, yes, of course, the letter.
Okay.
To the Guardian, New York Times, Der Spiegel, Washington Post, etc."

CALL TO THE INTERNET WORLD

Today marks the beginning of a new period in the history of the Internet. The past was marked by an ever-increasing number of vulnerabilities and corresponding exploits, through which anyone who knows them and has the necessary technical knowledge can gain unauthorized access to other people's computers and smartphones. And many people around the world are now able to do so. Not only people in secret services, governments, and companies, but also in criminal organizations and criminal individuals.

We consider any unauthorized access to personal information to be unlawful. The only exception to this is when there is an imminent danger to the freedom of people that may be averted by unauthorized access. In such cases, each individual access must be fully and wholly published shortly after that. Otherwise, in our opinion, keeping weak points secret, in particular, is an injustice. Everyone has a fundamental right to know what vulnerabilities the devices have that they use.

Today we published the most comprehensive database of unknown vulnerabilities ever published. Perhaps the largest there is: the vulnerability database of the TAO, a division of the NSA. This will, for the first time, make it transparent how much all computers and smartphones, tablets and other devices are interspersed with such vulnerabilities. The database does not include weaknesses in the computer systems of aircraft, satellites, power plants, transportation systems and hospitals, airports, and industrial facilities. There is another database for them that we could not hack.

As long as the now known vulnerabilities are not fixed by the programmers, it is very easy to penetrate almost all computers and smartphones and get to everything that is stored there. If your computer and smartphones on which the operating systems Windows, MacOS, Android, iOS, etc. are installed or others that are not free software, then we recommend that you do not use these devices for a few weeks. The only exception for Android is if you have the Android source code and of all the apps you use, and you can download them yourself and compile them. Otherwise, take out the battery or put your smartphone into a metal box.

All people programming for systems, applications and other software based on Linux, BSD or other free software have received a list of vulnerabilities from us weeks ago and have been working to close the gaps ever since. We recommend switching to one of these systems.

In our opinion, software should not be kept secret. Everyone has a right to know what the computer or smartphone they are using is actually doing.

Marlene looked at Fred with a dramatic look: "Well?
Should I send it now?"

"No!" Fred shouted with a pretended panic.
"BLOSS NICHT ... That confuses the powerful of the world!"
He opened his eyes and looked at them.

"Too late" grinned Marlene back.

Hans shouted from below: "Hey! Marlene! If you want to get to the ship in time, we have to go now." 

Fred and Marlene closed their laptops, put them in their packed suitcases, and left the room.
An hour later they were sitting on a small freighter heading for the mainland.
