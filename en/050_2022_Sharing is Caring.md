## **2022**** Sharing is Caring

<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Marlene and Fred</span> in a room in the attic of Hans' wooden house.
There were four laptops on the floor and the desk.
They both sat and typed.

Fred: "Good Internet here.
How do you conceal using Tor?
It might be noticeable if someone in the middle of nowhere suddenly sends a lot of goal data to the Internet, and Australia is not precisely a private-sphere friendly country."

Marlene: "Quite normal: via Tor Plugable Transports.
There you can choose from a whole range of how you want to go into the Tor network.
And change again and again.
I'm in the process of building my own entrance.
But now I mostly use the web or Skype option: Either it looks like I'm just surfing around or I'm skyping with someone, but in reality, I'm getting and sending gate data.
Teenagers abroad surf and Skype a lot.
And the operators who are responsible for this at the NSA have to take a closer look.
They're mostly snorers, I think.
Who does such a job?
Analyze Skype data?
You can't be there with your heart."

Fred: "Yes, they want to be all-powerful, huge, untouchable, so that you don't even get the idea of messing with them.
But these are mostly unmotivated civil servants in a giant apparatus.
Lunch break and holiday account are more important than a few hackers at the other end of the world.
And with that attitude, they can't find us.
- Okay. (laughs)
The data is ready.
I'm ready.
Who's first?"

Marlene: "As I said: Tor, Tails, Cubes, Subgraph, GPG and OTR.
We send the weaknesses of all your projects to you.
I've already warned the core people:
There's an earthquake coming, and a deluge.
They know precisely what happens if the information goes to the wrong people right now.
And they also know how to prevent it."

Fred: "Are we sending everything?"

Marlene nodded: "Yes, of course, everything about her projects.
Exactly the list you made.
It is crucial that there are no more gaps in the programs before things get huge.
We must be able to communicate."

Fred: "How much time do we give them?"

Marlene: "Let them say that themselves.
Three days, I guess."

Fred: "Three days?!
Are you out of your mind?
How can they fill the gaps in three days?"

Marlene: "With the six projects there are not so many.
They know exactly what to look for.
They are highly active in the project when security gaps occur and react immediately.
But we ask them.
You won't say much more than three days.
I'm still writing that we're under time pressure."

Fred: "And after that?
Here I have an info package for different Linux variants, for BSD, one for Mozilla, especially Firefox and Thunderbird, Pidgin, KeePassX and a few more."

Marlene: "Yes, that sounds good.
I now have a lot of current Ricochet addresses from all kinds of teams.
We will send them as soon as the vulnerabilities in the base programs are gone and we all have the new versions.
These teams need more time.
That's a lot of stuff.
And then let's get on with all the other Linux, Libre Office and hardware things."

Fred: "Lots of work."

Marlene: "Yes."

She's typing on her laptop.
"Okay, so... the messages to the first six teams are out.
I think we'll get a quick answer.
Now tell me, how was it with Anita and the terabyte?"

Fred: "Yes! Anita and the terabyte.
It's a story.
So, after the meeting with everyone: I get your pond message, which you also sent to Anita, and fall off the chair.
I hadn't really meant that with the Raspberry Pi in the chat: you could do it.
Then I get up again, breathe deeply, sit upright, and write the Raspberry program.
Not so difficult.
45 minutes.
Then I test it with a few thousand QR codes, it's okay, make an image of it and send it via Pond to Anita.
No answer, just a regular pond acknowledge.
She got it.
Okay, good, good.
Next, 22 hours 10 minutes later, I get a message that the files are safe on two 1TB sticks with the question of how to deliver them.
I fall from my chair for the second time, crawl out again, sit upright again, and continue reading.
She writes she may be followed by NSA people.
She suggests that she gives a stick in a restroom to the toilet attendant there who has been sitting there for 10, 15 years for sure.
She gives her 50 dollars and says that a man will come to her home who will give her another 50 dollars for the stick.
She gave me the woman's house address and said that she usually arrives at home at 6:20 pm.
Well, Anita must know that.
She's with NSA..."

Marlene: "Shit.
Did NSA surveillance help us with this operation now?"

Fred: "Never mind ...
So I'm going there at 6:30.
She opens the door, looks at me from top to bottom, turns around, and gets the stick.
I give her 50 bucks, and she says 100 dollars!
I close my eyes, wait two seconds, and then get another $50 bill out of my pocket.
She makes a face at all this as if she had just drowned a group of young poodles for fun.
She takes the two bills and gives me the stick.
I've got him in my hand.
My hand's starting to tingle.
I go back into my car and first have to breathe deeply and sit upright again.
And then I'm going straight home.
That's it."

Marlene laughed: "Geil.
Nice.
A toilet attendant."

"Pling," it came from Marlene's laptop.
"Roger answered: Three days!
I told you.
They're great boys!
It's so good that they exist."

Fred: "And girls.
Well, they're all at work now.
No lights are going out for three days now.
You bet your ass, you do."

Marlene: "And they rejoice like snow kings ... finally, some real data."

Fred: "They dance in circles..."

Marlene: "Christmas and birthday in one day."
