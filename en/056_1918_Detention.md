### SCENE 7
____
Wilhelm in his apartment in a Berlin apartment building.
In the morning, shaving.
// BLENDE //
Hilde in her apartment at the kitchen table having breakfast.

Wilhelm washes off the shaving soap and dries his face.
He looks at his watch and shouts, "Jesus Christ!"
He hurries out of the bathroom, puts on a shirt, then jacket and shoes, grabs his coat and leaves the apartment.
Two Spartacists are waiting outside his front door.
He nods to them and hurries down the stairs in front of them.
They follow.

Hilde puts her plate in the sink, prepares herself briefly in the mirror, puts on her coat.
That's when the doorbell rings.
She opens and smiles at Adolf.

Hilde: "Hej, on time like the train."

Adolf smiled: "I waited three minutes in the hallway..."

Hilde: "Come on, there's a lot to do today.
I have a good feeling that we're making progress with the soup kitchens."

She walks down the stairs in front, Adolf follows shortly behind her.

Wilhelm presses the handle of the front door and opens it with a swing.
A broad-shouldered man stands in front of him, grabs his chest and tears him onto the sidewalk.
Another one puts a potato sack over his head, kicks him in the stomach with his knee and pulls him into a waiting car that immediately races away.
Meanwhile, two other men have fallen towards the front door with rifles at the ready, shouting at the two Spartacists to drop their weapons.
The wide-shouldered man kicks the weapons into the street, searches the two, then pushes them, one with his left hand, one with his right, back into the hallway and slams the door.
Then everyone jumps onto a waiting platform truck and races away as well.

Hilde opens the front door and gets a blow to the head.
She sinks unconscious.
Two men drag her into a waiting car.
A man with a rifle aims at Adolf and he raises his hands immediately.
With panicked eyes, he looks at the man who says nothing.

Adolf: "NO! NOT..."

The man pulls the trigger.
A huge bang shakes the stairs.
He pulls the trigger again.
Adolf grabs his chest, feels warm blood.
He collapses on the cold stone floor, below him a large pool of blood forms.
