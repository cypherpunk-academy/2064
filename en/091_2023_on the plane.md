## **2023** On the plane

<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Marlene sat next to </span> Linda in a wide aircraft chair.
Through the window, you could see a carpet of clouds and bright sunshine.
They talked excitedly.
Further behind them, the president gave an interview to a television team at a conversation table.

Robert came by and quietly said to Linda, "She wants to talk to you.
In her cabin."

Linda nodded, got up, and disappeared behind a door.
The president followed her.

Inside, they both looked at each other.

Linda: "I know, I know.
It's a risk.
But it'll work.
It all fits in very well with our plan right now.
Just like the pardon thing.
We already had them on the plan."

President: "But how could it happen that everything was suddenly so airy, so unplanned, completely insecure?
How could the Farras suddenly show up?
I mean, they didn't say a thing before!
I don't want that to happen anymore."

Linda: "You didn't say a word.
It won't happen again.
But our plan will work.
The head of the Virginia prison, a colonel of the Rangers, was already assigned to the LBI.
He's in the same unit as the NSA director.
Really a coincidence.
Officially, they both lose their CIA jobs, and everyone's gonna do it for us.
Then they get their camouflage in the arms industry.
In two different places.
Nobody's gonna be surprised.
They'll like the new job at LBI, you can bet on that.
They get more powers and less control.
Everything's finally really classified again."

President: "That sounds good.
I still don't like the risk in this case, those ad hoc decisions in twenty minutes.
I was on one of those European talk shows last time.
The LBI is too important to risk that much.
We need it.
We need something that's really all ours again.
Where we can act freely.
Where millions of people don't look.
And we spend most of our time keeping things under the covers."

Linda: "The good thing is that with Marlene Farras, the masses in Europe will relieve us of the many changes in the NSA and the CIA.
This gives us the freedom to kick out a large number of people now and make them free for the LBI.
There are certainly some foreign secret services biting on and enticing people away, which we officially drop.
Then we get LBI in FSB or LBI in Mossad or better, the Chinese.
Believe me, that was a good thing that fell into our laps."

President: "Yes.
I might.
But we can't make any mistakes now."

Linda: "Don't worry.
Marlene is flying back to Berlin tomorrow with her brother.
The two become icons for the conversion of CIA and NSA to positive.
You'll see them both.
It gives people hope.
And that gives us room to maneuver."
