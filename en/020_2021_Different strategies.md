Heinz: "Look at this! Fuck! Marlene Farras was on an NSA TAO computer at Fort Meade taking data.
Our Marlene.
It's a thing!"

Frederik went over to Heinz and looked at his screen.

Frederik: "Who says?"

Heinz: "The American colleagues are good.
I hope they didn't kill anyone to get that information.
How do they know all of a sudden?
"There were only traces of Karl on the computer, I thought."

Frederik: "Karl's girlfriend.
She must have talked.
Or had to talk." He smiled.
"But at least they tell us something like that once.
Just like that... without consideration.
Who knows, maybe this could be the beginning of a trusting cooperation."

Heinz shook his head: "They don't just tell us."

Frederik bent over Heinz' shoulder and read the e-mail.
Then he shook his head wildly: "Sew! No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
You won't get Marlene!
Not from me.
Not now. Not now.
She can't go to America now.
We're so close.
One more step and she'll go to psychiatric voluntarily.
We can't just get her out of there right now.
And suicide isn't prepared.
There's going to be a riot.
The whole environment, family, friends.
It's a wasp's nest.
And if she just disappears like her brother now, we might get an initiative that stands in front of the American Embassy for a few weeks, or here, or a wild hash day in Twitter, #woistmarianne, or some other of those actions.
And then the press starts... way too much attention.
No can do.
I can't."

Heinz looked at Frederik skeptically: "And how are you going to do that?
I mean: You say no to the Americans and you can put your hand on the handset for the call, which is then made from the 13th floor.
Stock comes, where some greenhorn with a bloated chest gives you a nice greeting from the president and tells you that you have to do it after all."

Frederik had gone back to his seat and let himself fall into his chair.
"I can't give them up now.
Half a year, maybe.
Then they can have her.
But not now."

Frederik: "We can bring her here.
The Americans interrogate her and we bring her back.
Right now, nobody believes you anyway.
Probably wouldn't even tell.
Schorsch is pretty active right now.
And it's really good.
He's doing some things with her right now, you wouldn't believe.
So bold! Look here, you haven't seen this..."

Frederik showed Heinz a box with a diary, some clothes and a watch.

"Everything from Marlene," he grinned.
"Schorsch has been taking Schorsch out of her room for the last few days.
And always while she was in the room.
She barely leaves him.
Three in the morning.
A little gas, and she's asleep.
He can get in anywhere.
A total lunatic.
He even erases the images from the two surveillance cameras she has in her room.
The only thing he hasn't gotten to is her laptop.
She seems to have it in her sleeping bag right between her legs.
In the next few days, the things will come back to their places one by one."

"Between her legs? That's pretty paranoid," Heinz said.
"I think we'll have them soon.
No man can stand it."

Federik: "Yes, you put your diary on the table in a small room and the next morning it's gone.
You search everywhere.
Think you're going crazy.
And then two days later, all of a sudden, it's back.
That's good old decomposition.
My uncle was with the Stasi.
They have achieved quite a lot in this direction with their cute means.
The whole country trembled at them, at the lame pile of officials.
I was really scared! I'm telling you, the simplest things work best.
Manipulating computers.
Simply switch off and on the screen from time to time from a distance, let the program crash when the person is writing an important e-mail, hold the mouse pointer, delete a text passage, end a telephone call.
It's surveillance homeopathy.
So... We're not giving them out now!"

Heinz: "Then you need a pretty good story."

Frederik: "We tell them that she will soon be in a psychiatric ward.
That's where they get access.
Not now."
