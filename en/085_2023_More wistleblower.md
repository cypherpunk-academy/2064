Kevin: "Quick! Google. Facebook. Amazon. Apple."

Luke sat in front of his computer and typed.

Lukas: "What is it?"

The Google website appeared with a black background.

Kevin: "They did it. You really did it."

Anni shouted from further back: "Apple is also black."

Another student: "And Facebook."

Lukas: "Shit.
Everything on Google is black.
Not just the home page."

Kevin put a hand on Luke's shoulder: "Geil.
There, click on the button!"

In the meantime Anni, Sophie and Oskar had come to the computer of Lukas and had read along.
Other students joined them.

Oskar: "This is real.
This isn't open source and transparent insight into their server systems yet, but it's real."

Kevin: "Wow."

Lukas: "I'm flat."

Sophie: "I find it understandable that they do that.
What are they supposed to do, according to the NSA director?"

Annie: "Companies become Wistleblower! That's awesome."

Oskar: "Right, that's all that matters here:
They publish live.
And because they still have Wistleblower in their ranks, they have to publish everything.
If they report something new without anything moving on this website ..."

Kevin: "If our boys and girls report anything new at all ... You've said that CEOs are more likely to go to jail than continue to do what the intelligence agencies want."

Annie giggled: "Right now I would like to go to prison as CEO.
That'd be nice.
Imagine that: Larry Page in handcuffs for publishing a National Security Letter."

Oskar: "And ten minutes later pardoned by the president."

Everybody laughed.
