## **2023** More wistleblowers.

<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Kevin stormed into the classroom.</span>

Kevin: "Quick! Google. Facebook. Amazon. Apple."

Luke sat in front of his computer and typed.

Lukas: "What is it?"

The Google website appeared with a black background.

Kevin: "They did it. You really did it."

Anni shouted from further back: "Apple is also black."

Another student: "And Facebook."

Lukas: "Shit.
Everything on Google is black.
Not just the home page."

Kevin put a hand on Luke's shoulder: "Geil.
There, click on the button!"

JOINT OPINION

As a technology company, we have so far concentrated on what we do best: To offer as many users as possible the best technology experience there is. At the same time, we have always endeavored to comply with the legal frameworks that apply in each country. These are very different. China has different rules as Russia, the U.S. has different rules as Europe.


In our home country, we naturally had closer ties to government agencies. We had the confidence that this would not be exploited. We have set up direct access to user data. There were hundreds of thousands of requests to specific accounts. We never analyzed them.


Following recent events, we have now done that. What did we find out? Only a very small percentage of them were actually homeland security. Most of it was marked as requests for criminal cases. We already knew that. What we did not know was that the vast majority of criminal cases were suspicious. No charges were brought, and no trial was underway. The mere expression of suspicion was enough to justify a question. This is an abuse of the access systems that we have made available. We have now finally shut down and deleted these systems.


As of today, we will no longer follow instructions which again require direct access. Inquiries must be made in writing by post. We will also automatically inform the user concerned of the access six weeks after each request.


We have activated a website:

www.nsl-and-gag-orders.com

There everyone can see which instructions we currently get from the government. NSL means National Security Letter. It contains the actual instructions, for example, how to install a vulnerability. GAG orders are instructions for secrecy. They threaten the disclosure of NSLs with imprisonment. We do it anyway because we are convinced that we must do it now.

In the meantime, Anni, Sophie, and Oskar had come to the computer of Lukas and had read along.
Other students joined them.

Oskar: "This is real.
This isn't open source and transparent insight into their server systems yet, but it's real."

Kevin: "Wow."

Lukas: "I'm flat."

Sophie: "I find it understandable that they do that.
What are they supposed to do, according to the NSA director?"

Annie: "Companies become whistleblowers! That's awesome."

Oskar: "Right, that's all that matters here:
They publish live.
And because they still have whistleblowers in their ranks, they have to publish everything.
If they report something new without anything moving on this website ..."

Kevin: "If our boys and girls report anything new at all ... You've said that CEOs are more likely to go to jail than continue to do what the intelligence agencies want."

Annie giggled: "Right now, I would like to go to prison as CEO.
That'd be nice.
Imagine that: Larry Page in handcuffs for publishing a National Security Letter."

Oskar: "And ten minutes later, pardoned by the president."

Everybody laughed.
