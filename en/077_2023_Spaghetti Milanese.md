## **2023** Spaghetti Milanese

<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Marlene and Luigi</span> sat on the terrace in front of their laptops and listened intently to the President's last words.
They looked at each other in the eye for a moment.
Then they both pulled up their arms and laughed.

Marlene: "Yeah!
Yes!
That's really awesome!
Luigi!
The mountain has moved!
We're on it, we're close..."

Luigi: "Oh, oh, the secret services won't like that.
But it was inevitable.
They mess with the top companies, America needs them at least as much as the secret services.
And the companies are really sore now because of our boys and girls.
Julian had already foreseen this at the beginning of the 2000s: Whistleblowing makes the breakthrough."

Marlene: "Yes, something is possible now.
Now we have to stay tuned.
What the president said will cause confusion.
Total chaos in the intelligence community.
They won't just take it.
That's where we'll get our odds."

Luigi: "In any case, there will now be a bunch of new vulnerability reports.
We might get real, regular vulnerability updates from internal people at companies.
How awesome..."

Marlene: "Yes, that's awesome!
The big companies, the governments, they're so dependent on the little people.
They need us as consumers, as workers, as accomplices.
It won't work without us.
That's the dictate of the masses.
That's what Marwin used to say.
I've never seen this so clearly in public.
So awesome!"

She put her face in her hands.
"Horny... horny... Marwin... If only he knew... - - Shit.
Maybe he won't even notice."

She closed her eyes.
After a while, she got up and walked towards the railing.

Luigi: "Marlene!!"

Marlene: "Good, good.
I'm not going up front."
She sat cross-legged on the floor.
"Where is he now?
I finally want to know where he is."

Luigi: "You went through all your contacts for the last time three days ago.
He's in America, somewhere in America.
Most likely in a CIA prison.
There's nothing new about it.
But try it again."

Marlene: "Someday, I'll find a trail."
She got up, sat down on her chair, took her laptop, and started typing.

Luigi: "I make spaghetti Milanese.
With Parmigiano-Reggiano and a hint of pepper.
And a Valpolicella Rossa."

Marlene didn't react.
She typed and looked spellbound at her screen.
Luigi disappeared into the apartment.

Marlene said to herself after a while, "No wine for me."
