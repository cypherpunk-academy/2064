## **2021**** Escape from the basement

<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Marlene scared</span> up in bed.
It was 2:30.
Her alarm clock had given a short beep.
She wiped her eyes and opened the zipper of her sleeping bag.
Her first grip was on her two laptops, which she always took with her in her sleeping bag.
That's what her brother had said: always keep tools with you.
She got up, put on a pair of pants and slipped into her sneakers.
Was that a quiet scratch out in the hall? Or is it? There, again, almost inaudible.
She really had to get out of here now, or she'd go crazy.
Marwin always said that the secret services were capable of anything, nothing was sacred to them, not even their own home.
"At some point they will be called to account," Marlene thought, "and if I have to take care of it myself.

She pushed the desk away.
Behind it a radiator appeared, which at first sight looked like a normal radiator.
But he wasn't.
Marwin had put it there to cover a secret passage he had built with a friend the summer before last.
A real underground passage, through the house wall, under the lawn up to a garden house.
Total length about 25 meters.
Maybe we need that once, he told Marlene.
Maybe we need to get out of the house sometime without anyone noticing.
A small lever released a lock, then the heating could be swung away by two hinges.
Marlene looked into the dark corridor, it smelled a little musty, but otherwise looked okay.
Then she picked up some clothes and put them together with a wash bag and her laptops in a backpack.
She disappeared into the corridor and pulled the radiator behind her, which snapped in with a full clack.
Slightly bent, but relatively comfortable, she walked along the corridor and climbed over a small ladder in the garden house.
Then she disappeared over the adjacent cornfield in the darkness.

It ran long, two hours, three hours, towards the city centre, to Jannowitzbr√ºcke and there to c-base, the well-known hacker space.
On her way she followed her brother's camera card as best she could.
On this map most of the surveillance cameras of the city were marked with range and direction.
There were still relatively good ways into the city on foot.
The actions against surveillance cameras in Berlin had had an effect.
Sometimes she had to walk a little strange paths and take care that it didn't look too strange for people she met on the way.

Their goal was a project in the c-base, the so-called Dead Space, which was so shielded that no radio signals could enter or exit from the outside.
At the same time, any foreign electromagnetic radiation was detected by computers, mobile phones and other devices brought along.
The game was to take photos, films or sound recordings inside and bring them out, or to attack one of the computers in the room from outside without the security system noticing.
Whenever the system detected an attempt, a large screen jumped to the ceiling and an animated Guy Fawkes mask dramatically and funny warned of the intruder.
Over time, the attempts had become more and more sophisticated, hackers came from far away to try to trick the system.
Each successful attack led to new countermeasures, so the system became better and better.
In the meantime, you had to put a lot of effort into cutting or smuggling something in.

Marlene has had a voucher for her own computer since a hackathon competition two years ago.
And that's what she wanted to do now.
She wanted to hide in public for at least some time, in places where many people were around her.
She assumed that whatever secret service was after her, he would suspect her hidden somewhere with friends or acquaintances.
They would guard all the places where she had been in recent years, where she had contact that were somehow private.
She now bet everything on this hunch.
Your brother had said that such things should be decided with emotion and sometimes you would have to do things that seem absurd.
She wanted to sleep every day from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. in one of the bunk beds in the basement of the c-base.
The rest of the time she wanted to sit in front of her computer in Dead Space with a poodle cap and work on something ... yes, what on? What would she be working on? "Exactly!" she thought, holding the USB stick in her pocket with her hand.
That's what she wanted to do.
She wanted to take a good look at him now.

It was about 5am when she knocked on a side window at c-base where she saw a group of hackers around some laptops.
One stood up, glanced at her membership card and let her in.
Inside, Marlene dropped onto a sofa and breathed deeply.
One of the boys brought her a mate.
