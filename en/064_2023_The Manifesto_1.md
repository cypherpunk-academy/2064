## **2023** The Manifesto (1)

<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Marwin walked up and down the meeting room with </span> a pen in his mouth.
Suddenly he made a big step towards the wall, stopped in front of it and bobbed on his feet: "Encryption, encryption ... Hmm.
And then... Yes!" He snapped his fingers.
"Yes, exactly!" He sat down at the table, turned the pages and wrote:

"2 -- The great ideals of our time, economic growth, money gain and security, no longer apply.
We can't carry her in our hearts anymore.
They create opposition, distrust and fear everywhere.
We need new ideals, stronger ideals, ideals that can unhinge everything that is old and encrusted.
And we already have these ideals, everyone has them.
For example: justice, transparency of public life, overcoming oppression (no more bosses!), creative togetherness, trust, courage..."

He turned the page.

"3 - We must overcome our opposition.
There's only one humanity.
Being against each other separates what in reality belongs together.
There are no terrorists, no anarchists and no Nazis.
There are only people who are blinded by the opposition, who kill, rape, intimidate, abuse, oppress, belittle or set shitstorms in motion because they themselves are afraid, because they are blind from fear.
Fear is curable."

He turned the page.

"4 -- We must keep holy the power of initiative in every human being, even those within ourselves.
Create spaces for it, spaces in which we meet each other, meet others, invent things together, be creative, freely follow our own impulses.
We must learn where the borders to the other are, when I hurt the impulse of the other, and learn to withdraw there and let him live."

Marwin took the pen between his teeth, stood up and started walking around the room again.
Every now and then he stopped, bounced his feet.
After a while he looked at the mirror wall, behind which people were probably sitting and watching him.
He smiled warmly in her direction.

"What may be going on in them now?" he thought.
"Why do they do such a boring job of observing him even though they have no interest at all in him as a human being?
They look hours and hours at something they don't care about.
This is a waste of time.
Five days a week, that kind of work?
No, I couldn't do that.
And they certainly think of themselves on the better, more pleasant side of history, on the freer side.
But that's an illusion.
Victor Frankl experienced the greatest moments of his own freedom in a German concentration camp as a prisoner, not as a guard.
Yes, I can understand that now," Marwin thought and stretched out his arms in the air.
"Yes ... to understand the other.
Think yourself into him.
That's it."

He took the pencil out of his mouth, sat down again, turned the pages and wrote.

"5 -- Empathy is the art of thinking and feeling oneself so far into another that one understands why he does what he does.
So much so that you say to yourself that you would do the same if you were in his place and had his story.
No child is born with an urge to kill another human being.
We'll buy him.
Children do not know a superior race, people, nation or company where some people are worth more than others.
Making such differences between people is alien to us as a child.
We'll learn later.
That's why we can unlearn it again."

He put the pencil on the table and straightened up and said loudly: "Yes, we can unlearn that again!
Then he said, "But how?
How do we unlearn that?"
