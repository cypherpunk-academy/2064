## **2021** The psychologist

<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">It knocked on</span> Marlene's door.
She got scared.
"Who was that now?" She breathed deeply.
The strange experience with Corinne was still everywhere in her limbs.

Her mother said through the door, "It's me, your mama."

Marlene: "I don't want to go now."

Mother: "Stefanie is here.
She wants to talk to you."

Marlene: "I talked to her."

Stefanie was the psychologist who thought Marlene had discovered a post-traumatic disorder.
She was 35 years old and close friends with her mother.
Surely she didn't ask her mother for money for the conversations, she did it out of the best will to help because she liked her mother so much.
Nothing Marlene remotely needed now.
She needed a human, just common sense, not a psychologist.
Someone who tried to understand them and didn't want to change them.

"Marlene, I have an idea I'd like to share with you," Stefanie said through the door.
"Maybe we can use it to improve the situation."

Marlene didn't answer.
She sat down on her sofa and closed her eyes.

Stefanie: "I'll grab a chair here and wait until you're ready.
It's important to me.
Take your time."

Marlene tried to meditate, at least to do what she imagined she would do.
In any case, it was good for her to seek her inner balance for a while.
And that usually even worked in real stress situations, such as the one she was in at the time.
Marwin had told her what he did when everything went wrong with him, and he no longer knew where he was or where he could go.
She had made her own thing out of it.
So she sat cross-legged on the sofa with her eyes closed, one leg on the floor and quietly said, "My life is not in danger.
I don't need anything from the outside to be satisfied.
I've got everything I need.
I don't have to do anything right."

After about a quarter of an hour, she got up, stepped slowly to the door, opened it, and looked at Stefanie, who was sitting on a chair on the basement wall reading a book.
Stefanie looked up and smiled at Marlene, wanted to get up, but Marlene gave her a sign and sat down against the wall.

Marlene: "What are you trying to tell me?"

Stefanie also sat on the floor.
"I've been thinking a lot about your situation.
What you got stuck in.
I didn't understand."

Marlene asked concentrated: "What didn't you really understand?"

Stefanie: "It's real.
Absolutely real.
You have no choice but to see it differently.
It's absolutely real! In a way."

Marlene looked at the floor.
A quiet rage went up in her.
She hated manipulation.

Stefanie: "Your body makes it real.
How the body can hold back the blood in a shock, even if you have a large wound.
Likewise, the body can bind your thinking, it can determine what you think.
It's like you're in prison, except you can't see or feel the bars.
I hope so much that perhaps you suspect something about it, that you feel that something is wrong with your thinking."

Marlene answered without looking up from the floor: "And then my body conjures a police car into my memory, from which three men get out, talk to my brother, then look at me and get in without saying goodbye?

Stefanie nodded thoughtfully: "Yes.
That's possible."

Marlene: "And how do you explain that I had already told you about this before I even got the letter from Marwin in which he wrote that he was gone?

Stefanie: "I've already thought about that.
You may have guessed before that your brother wants to leave, or you may have noticed it on the sidelines."

Marlene: "On the sidelines? I noticed it on the sidelines and was so shocked by it that my thinking was tied up." Marlene felt that rage was rising in her but continued to speak in a calm tone.

Stefanie: "I think he told you before!"

Marlene bursted out: "AND YOU JUST INVENT ALL OF THIS, SHIT! IT'S ALL MADE UP! You keep on saying, "That could be.", "I think.", "Maybe."
It's not facts, it's not true, it's your imagination."

Stefanie replied with an understanding voice: "It's improbable that your brother would just get into the car like that.
Without asking the cops or saying goodbye.
He looks at a tablet, and that's it.
Hej, he was a professional hacker, he had dealt with policemen umpteen times and made them white hot.
A judge once yelled at him and then broke off the trial, and he stayed calm.
I was in that room, I can still see his quiet smile today.
And does anything that he reads on a tablet display make him get into a police car just like that, without question, without resistance?" She looked at Marlene very closely.

Marlene froze.
Why did he just get on the train like that? What's the matter with you? She'd asked herself that a thousand times.
She didn't know.

Stefanie: "I think, and I am a psychologist, I believe that your brother got into a car with friends and drove away with them.
He gave you one more look, but he didn't say anything.
But that look made you understand he's not coming back.
And a world has collapsed for you.
An average car has turned into a police car and three friends, two policemen, and a secret service man.
You came home that day, crying all to hell.
What's the matter with you? Where were you?"

"In Wedding, at City Hall," she said quietly, burying her face in her hands.

Stefanie put her hand on Marlene's shoulder, but she pushed it back.

Stefanie: "Come.
You could go for a few weeks here in Berlin to the Havelh√∂he.
There's an institute there where you can relax.
And maybe you can find the real story there.
If you want.
Do you want that?"

Marlene slowly looked up at Stefanie with a questioning look.
Then she rose and disappeared into her room.
