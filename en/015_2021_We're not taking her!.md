## **2021**** We're not taking her!

At the headquarters of the BND in Berlin.

<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">"We won't get them.</span> Basta!" Frederik yelled at his colleague Heinz across his desk.

"Why? She met her brother right after the break-in.
That's no coincidence.
She must know something," Heinz replied somewhat angry, but still calm.

Frederik: "Maybe she knows something about it.
Maybe she's just guessing.
In any case, she does understand what her brother is doing.
I saw her here last year at a hackathon.
There she showed what she can do ...
Still, we're not going to get them."
He looked at Heinz seriously.
"I'm serious about this.
This is an official order."

Heinz swallowed.
"We should leave no stone unturned if we want to find out what they were up to with the TAO servers..."

Frederik: "Stop it! You don't get it.
It's not always about finding out what's going on.
That's even irrelevant right here.
It's about more than that.
Marlene Farras is hanging in there with her heart.
She's infected by her brother.
And that's what this is about: An infection, a tumor.
And you have to treat it before it grows any bigger.
On the one hand, of course, he has to get out.
But on the other hand, he shouldn't come back.
And that means it's not just about cutting out as much as you need.
But to treat the whole environment in such a way that nothing grows there anymore.
Only then will we have a chance to stop this.
And we can use Marlene Farras for that."

Heinz: "Hey, Frederik, slow down.
They're human, not cancer."

Frederik: "Yes, it's just a picture.
I don't mean that so hard.
You know me. You know me.
But what good would it do if the Farras continued where their brother left off?
She's got the talent for it.
Also talent to remain anonymous.
I've been looking for her on the Tor network before, with the help of some NSA guys.
We had quite a few computers in use at the time to find their tracks, a few thousand, just for them.
But we didn't find anything.
Nothing. Nothing.
She does it very skilfully.

But now we have her in the corner! Her brother's gone, she's looking for him.
There is not much missing, nor a few really bad news, a few actions in her environment and she leaves the hacking for all time.
And everyone around her will see that, they'll think she's paranoid or schizophrenic and eventually she really will be.
And only then is there real peace.
Your whole environment must think you have to be crazy to mess with us.
That's worth more than another hacker in prison who might be making new plans there.
Or worse, like Edward Snowden or Julian Assange ... "Better a man goes through a difficult time than everything gets on fire."

Heinz: "Come on, over here".
He pointed to his screen.
"Look, the guys from NSA.
You wouldn't believe it.
Marlene Farras just had chat contact ... with the girlfriend of ... Karl.
Karl, you know, the satellite man from Virginia.
Hot stuff."

Frederik nodded: "Wow.
How'd you do that? Then we also have to put Karl's girlfriend on the list.
Or maybe not.
I think the Americans are taking good care of it.
But really strange, how did they get together?"

Heinz: "So far no trace of it.
We could ask Marlene Farras... Shouldn't we ask her..."

Frederik: "No! She stays where she is.
I will once again search the Tails activities on the Internet for chat connections between New Jersey and Berlin.
Maybe we'll find something."
