### SCENE 10

____
At a canal in Berlin, dawn, an all-terrain truck drives up and stops with squeaking brakes.

Driver and passenger jump out of the car and open the rear door.
Two soldiers come out and drag Hilde and Wilhelm behind them.
Both are blindfolded.
Wilhelm can hardly stand on his feet.
They are led to the water and must kneel down.
Then driver and passenger each pull a pistol, they hold the two to the head.
They pull the trigger without hesitation.
The bodies collapse together in itself and remain at the edge of the shore.
One of the soldiers pushes them with several steps into the water, until they are carried along by the current.
Driver to the other three: "Good work!"
The passenger nods: "Thank you!"
