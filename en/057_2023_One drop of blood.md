## **2023** One drop of blood

<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Marwin looked at the door</span> and thought: "Still no guards ... It's been at least half an hour since Linda fled the room.
Yes, she escaped.
But from what?
Evidently from saying something about Marlene... Shit.
Shit.
Shit... What about Marlene? ...Linda knows where she is ... Yes.
She doesn't want to find her.
She doesn't need me to find her because she knows where she is.
But then what does she want?
Why release me?
It doesn't make any sense."

"Damn it!" he said out loud.
"Fucking hell!"

He put his head on the table.
His nose started bleeding.
He crumpled a piece of handkerchief together and pressed it into his nostrils.

"Marlene is forcing her to release me," he thought, smiling, "Yes, that would suit her."
He nodded. "Nice thought, but, shit, no.
They won't let you blackmail them.
Not on principle.
You are the greatest world power, the greatest country there has ever been.
They're all part of a miracle dream, the elite nation of the world.
No, there can't be an 18-year-old girl coming and forcing her to do anything."

He buried his head under his hands.
"Or was it really a change of heart?
Linda had something in mind: They're going to dissolve the NSA... No, that's bullshit.
At best, because they have something better and they don't need it anymore.
Certainly not because they recall their ideals: On freedom, self-development, letting the neighbor live his life.

Or are they really starting to take their own ideals seriously?
To take yourself seriously?
Not to relate the ideals only to their country?
No.
Their goal is to conquer the world.
It's the only thing that makes sense to them in a crazy world.
Order through power.
The strong can do his bidding, the weak his not.
If the world is to continue well, then we must control it, with our armies, with our financial industry, with the arms industry, with the Internet industry, Google, Apple, Microsoft, with fast food, Coca Cola and with the mass media.
Control every aspect of life.
That's the big target.
And when you have achieved that, then you can guarantee the freedom of people - at least of some people.
The maximum happiness for the maximum number of people."

He punched the table with his fist: "Fuck." He thought, "That's the most demonic saying there is, because it sounds reasonable, and it's so hard to see through.
Excluding people: If the greatest country that has ever existed rules, then there is freedom for all those who submit to its culture, its ideas of life.
And every enemy of his way of living is an enemy of freedom and is rendered harmless.
For example, hackers, especially cypherpunks."

He grabbed his head with both hands.
"With violence to harmony... With oppression to freedom...
What makes people fail in their thinking so dramatically?
What makes hundreds of millions of people, in governments, in state apparatuses, in companies, think such nonsense?
Why can they think that power can solve problems, concentration of power, in our time?
Power must fall into the hands of the people who actually do: program, build, plant, clean ...
Power must spread like water over a watering can.
Not like a reservoir rupture."

He breathed heavily.

"And because of this error of thought, I have been sitting here for two years now, completely senseless, without charge, not even an accusation, not even a false allegation.
If only ten, twenty percent of the population were real hackers, cypherpunks, people with cypherpunk hearts, things would look different."

He looked around the room and got stuck on the table with a little book and a pen that Linda had forgotten there.
He looked at her and then suddenly shouted, "Yah!
That's right.
A manifesto!
Like Eric Hughes in 1993.
I'm writing a hacker manifesto, a new cypherpunk manifesto.
That's what it is.
And if no one ever reads it..."
He pulled the booklet towards him, tore out all the pages already written and arranged them in a pile on the table.
Then he opened the first page and took the pen.
He thought, "Eric Hughes ... Encryption" and began to write:

<div style="background-color: #222; color: lightgreen; padding: 20px; margin: 20px 0; font-family: 'Courier New'">
Everything starts with encryption.
</div>
He looked at the first sentence, nodded and continued writing.

<div style="background-color: #222; color: lightgreen; padding: 20px; margin: 20px 0; font-family: 'Courier New'">
1 -- Encryption is the basis of our personal freedom. We must be able to choose who gets our information and who doesn't. We must be able to hide, to elude the gaze of those who want to destroy what we create. Every beginning needs protection.
</div>
A drop of blood fell from his nose onto the paper.
It looked at him with fascination and made sure that it did not flew away, but dried as he was.
