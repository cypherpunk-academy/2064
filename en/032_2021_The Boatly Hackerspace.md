## **2021** The Boatly Hackerspace

<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Achmed came into the caf√© from </span> the beach side and sneaked up on Marlene from behind.
He grabbed her by both shoulders and kissed her on the cheek.
Marlene turned around in horror but smiled when she saw Achmed.
They kissed.
Achmed jumped over the pillows that Marlene leaned against and landed next to her with a broad, warm smile.
His eyes sparkled.
He took her hand.

Achmed: "You are so beautiful, I cannot believe it.
I could just look at you all the time.
Come on. I have something to show you.
Really great.
It's a surprise.
We'll have to dive a little for that.
Have you ever dived before?"

Marlene looked skeptically: "Yes.
But only with snorkel, no bottle."

Achmed: "It doesn't matter.
It's not that deep, and I'm the best instructor on the beach."

Marlene: "I can't go diving now."

Achmed: "Come.
You'll love it.
I'm sure it is.
Mohammed also thinks you'll like it."

Marlene says, "Okay.
Did he say that? ...then, okay." She hesitated again.
"No, I can't."

Achmed raised his index finger: "Ah, sure.
I know."

He jumped up behind the bar and came back with a black rubber briefcase.

Achmed: "Here for your laptops.
It's waterproof.
"You can take them with you."

Marlene looked at him in amazement, took the suitcase and in fact, it was big enough for both laptops.

Achmed: "I can strap him on.
It's better if you don't have that much weight on you the first time.
Wait here, I'll be right back."

He jumped up and came back minutes later, fully loaded with diving equipment.


They put on their equipment and went to the beach, where a small fishing boat with an outboard engine lay.
Marlene got into the boat, Achmed pushed it out and jumped in.
He started the engine, and the boat made a set forward.
Marlene, who had not yet sat down properly, lost her balance and fell on Achmed's lap.
He put his arm around her.

Achmed grinned: "This is my specialty! I've practiced for this for a long time." Both smiled and kissed.
Achmed stepped on the gas.

"So beautiful!" Marlene thought, leaning against the chair, let the wind blow through her hair.
"It could always be that way."

About 500 meters further Achmed stopped the boat.
He got up and looked into the water, he seemed to be looking for something.
He looked back at the beach, which was still good to see.
Then he seemed to discover something and threw the anchor.

Achmed: "We can go in here.
There, strap on the oxygen bottle, put on your glasses and then, look, here, you let yourself fall in here backward this way, then nothing happens."

Both took their bottles, put on their glasses, and Marlene let herself fall into the water.
Achmed jumped after him.
Underwater he gave her a sign to follow him.
It went deeper and also quite a way away from the boat.
They swam for about five minutes before Achmed dived down into a gorge and a grey metallic something emerged from the shadow.

"What's that? So big! Big time.
Probably 30 meters long," Marlene thought.
"Hmm? A ship? Yes, a ship." It lay a little tilted at the lower edge of the gorge at a depth of about 20 meters and was apparently still quite completely preserved.
But old, very old.
Mohammed was tampering with a rotating wheel on a metal door, and after a few attempts, it opened.
He gave Marlene a sign to follow him and disappeared into it.
Inside was a corridor leading up to a staircase.
They swam down, again a passage, once on the right and then a small metal ladder up again through a hatch.
And behind it, it was different, strange light.
Achmed swam up, and his head disappeared.
You chase them and: Air.
A water surface and air.
In a pretty big room.
They took off their diving masks.

Marlene: "Wow! It's a thing.
Where does the air come from? This is good air."

Achmed: "From the beach.
We've laid a hose so you can't see anything on the surface of the water." He formed a circle with his thumb and index finger.
"So fat.
We pump air through there now and then.
And look there!" He pointed to the end of the room: "There was a table, a bench, chairs, a refrigerator, a lamp on a large grid pedestal, entirely outside the water, and further back, a bed.
There was a sign to the right of the ladder that led out of the water:

"Dahab Boatly Hackerspace"

Marlene laughed out loud: "How awesome!" She swam there and climbed out of the water.

Marlene: "Geil! A hacker's space! But then there must also be Internet here..."

Achmed: "Sure.
1 Gigabit Internet.
Not quickly, but at least" He pointed to a cable dangling from the ceiling.
"And light!" He turned on the light.

Marlene took off her diving gear and sat on the bench.


Marlene: "How awesome! I want to stay here."

Achmed: "Sure, you can.
This is for you now."

Marlene: "I'm serious.
That's just the thing right now.
I'm on something I'd love to do from here right now."

Achmed: "I know." He smiled.

Marlene looked at him questioningly.

Achmed: "I don't know much.
Mohammed said, take Marlene to Boatly.
She'll like it, and she'll want to stay.
And when Mohammed says that, it's true.
And I'll bring you some food.
Just like the day before yesterday.
Then you can stay all here."

Marlene: "Wow.
"This is a five-star restaurant, too."

She unpacked one of the laptops and plugged in power and network cables.
