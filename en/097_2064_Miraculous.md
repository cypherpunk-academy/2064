## **2064** Miraculous

Sigur looked at Miraculous defiantly: "Where did I screw up?"

Miraculous shrugged his shoulders: "No idea.
But you did. Otherwise, you wouldn't be here, you'd be at Lasse's caf√©.
He's about to go out and get a cold mate."

Miraculous grinned carefully.

Sigur sat cross-legged in front of him: "And now what?
What can I do here now?"

Miraculous shrugged his shoulders again.
"Wait?"

Sigur: "On what?"

Miraculous: "Nothing."

Sigur: "And then?"

Miraculous: "Then there will be an end to the game."

"No!" Sigur roared.
"NO!
I was so close.
I'm so close to it.
I'm not giving up now."

Miraculous: "You told the owl that you wanted to go to island level 4.
That's a statement you can't take back so easily."

Sigur: "But I want this!
I want Level 4."

Miraculous: "You can't go to level 4.
You killed a man who wasn't a direct threat to another man's life.
And you can't do that.
You can't do that in level 3, and you can't do that a hundred times in level 4.
I'll tell you one thing, you fucked!"

Sigur angry: "Where?
Where did I kill a man who didn't threaten anyone?"

Miraculous: "And you can't even go back to level 2 or something, or all the way out of the academy.
You said you wanted to go to level 4.
And that goes for it.
The owl warned you."

Sigur: "She didn't!"

Miraculous: "She did!"

Sigur: "She didn't!"

Miraculous: "She said that you are not ready.
And you wiped that out and said, "You're ready.
The owl does not become clearer.
What the owl says is true.
She's not telling you what to do.
She's just saying what is.
Past and wisdom and all that.
Do you understand me?" He looked at him pitifully.
"You're Cypherpunk now.
You're big yourself.
You're free to aspire to what you want.
Even if it's total nonsense to want that, and you can never get there with the modest possibilities you have."

Sigur closed his eyes and clenched both fists.

Miraculous: "You screwed!"

Sigur: "I HAVE NOT!
There's always a way out at the Cypherpunk Academy.
There are no final dead ends here.
Not at all. Not at all.
Nowhere!"

Miraculous: "Here you go.
Then look around you!
Stone walls, about a meter thick, bars, no file, no hammer or anything.
How are you gonna get out of here?
Maybe I could eat you up and carry you out through the bars piece by piece."

Sigur tried to beat Miraculous, but he hurried to the side and hid behind a stone.

Miraculous trembled all over his body: "Hej!
What are you doing, man?
I'm the only friend you have left.
Where's everybody else?
If you need them, they're not there.
And anyway, you're going against someone who's not an immediate threat again.
This seems to be your sport.
Being against it is not for Cypherpunks, not from level 3.
Now get a grip, or you're really not getting out of here, you weakling, you... victim."

Sigur: "Where did I kill a man?"

Miraculous: "One?
Three.
In the first of the helicopters that chased your flying combat robot."

Sigur: "That was FBI!
They were chasing me.
To death.
They were going to shoot rockets at the robot.
If I'd been in it, they'd have killed me,"

Miraculous: "Would, would, would.
You're not a man of urgency.
If you'd been in there, I think you could have shot her.
Or maybe not.
I'm not sure.
The academy's rule masters sometimes have strange views.
You'd better ask the bear.
But you weren't in the combat robot at all.
You were in a bunker pushing buttons, that's all.
Like a coward."

Sigur took a breath.
He thought of the other two helicopters, which he had fetched from heaven shortly after the first one, and of the police car.

Sigur: "But this is war.
People die in war."

Miraculous: "War is a game.
Just because you play, that doesn't mean you're suddenly allowed to kill people.
You can't kill people.
You can't do that.
Not as Cypherpunk."

Sigur looked at him confused: "You can't kill people in war?
What the fuck is this?
Lasse has also..."

Miraculous interrupted with a snide hand movement: "With such an attitude, you will sit here for a long time to come.
Level 4?
Pah.
I'm laughing myself to death.
Where did Lasse kill someone?"

Sigur: "The Five Star."

Miraculous: "Hello, you don't check anything.
They were all flying combat robots.
"Broken material is not a problem."

Sigur: "But then, then many people died."

Miraculous: "If he could not prevent, he is not responsible for it.
That was in the thread of his destiny, the bear would probably say now."

Sigur: "Two of his combat robots have flown in the attack on the NSA building."

Miraculous: "Those two didn't kill anybody.
But you're a little right.
It was close... You programmed the air fight with the F22 pilots.
Five people died in the process.
It's on your account, too.
The more I look at this.
You can fold the whole thing here.
In the academy, it's not gonna work out with you anymore." He grinned at him broadly.

Sigur's eyes got darker.
He slipped over to the wall and leaned against it.
"Okay.
I made a mistake.
They're dead.
What do you want me to do?
You want me to stay here till the end of the game?
What sense would that make?"

Miraculous: "A lot of sense.
There'd be one less person on the road killing other people.
It makes sense if you don't do anything anymore.
You can just stay here and wait for the game to end."

Sigur grabbed the stone and threatened to throw it.

Miraculous ducked in an exaggerated panic: "Stop!
Stop! Stop!
Are you out of your mind?
I'm the only one who can help you out of here."

Sigur truncated.
He put the stone back on the ground: "So can you help me?
You know a way out, don't you?
Then you lied."

Miraculous held his mouth shut in fright and stammered: "No, no, n...yes.
The part of my brain I was thinking with earlier didn't know that."

Sigur: "Tell me, how does it get out of here?

Miraculous: "That's what you have to find out.
Not me."

Sigur clenched his fist and raised it.

Miraculous: "Hej!
Third basic idea: Not against it.
That also applies to my dealings with you!
And I'm not against you.
I'm just saying how things are."

Sigur put his hand down, looked at her.

Sigur: "Okay.
No more violence."

Miraculous exhaled with relief.
"And how are you gonna do that?
You have so much in you against each other.
You're full of it, you fool, you donkey, you little man!"

Sigur tried to catch him again but just remembered.

Sigur: "Wonderful, come tell me what I can do.
You have nothing more to fear from me."

Miraculous: "You never know.
"Only vain sunshine and right after that, you get another stone thrown in."

Sigur: "No, really!
I get it."

Miraculous came a little closer: "Good!
What can you do?
For example, you can make a running jump here and jump against this stone there, the huge one.
Take the whole cell approach, take it off the grid, and then take it all down."

Sigur went to the stone and examined it.
He couldn't see anything unusual.

Sigur: "This stone here?"

Miraculous nodded: "Or... maybe the other one next to it." He looked doubtfully, but then immediately grinned and said, "No, the one you're pointing at."

Sigur shook the stone.
He didn't move.
He hit it with his hand.
It seemed like an ordinary stone.
Then he went to the gate, wanted to take a run up, but hesitated.
He waved off.

Sigur: "That doesn't make any sense.
It's just an ordinary stone.
There should be a little clue."

Miraculous suddenly had a spoon in his hand and showed it to Sigur.
"Look, you know Neo from Zion, don't you?
Look, this isn't a spoon!
There's no spoon.
Well?
It's not a stone.
Do you understand?"

Sigur nodded.
He took a running jump, jumped and crashed with full force with body and head on the stone.
He bounced back and hit the ground with his arm.
The whole arm was burning with pain, his head was booming, he was dizzy.
The stone hadn't moved a millimeter.
He got a throbbing headache.

Sigur held his head and shouted, "Are you sure it was the stone?"

Miraculous: "Yeah, sure.
That's the stone I meant.
Maybe you weren't fast enough."

Sigur looked at him in disbelief.

Miraculous: "On the other hand, why should he move.
It's a stone walled into a prison wall.
They usually do it so well that you can't just push it out by jumping at it."

Sigur: "But it's a hidden exit, isn't it?"

Miraculous: "Why do you mean that?
I think it's a natural stone."

In Sigur, fury was rampant again.
He walked up to Miraculous.
He hid in a corner.

Sigur "You said it was the stone, and if I jump against it..."

Miraculous: "Then?"

Sigur: "Then..."

Miraculous: "Then?"

Sigur: "I asked you what I could do..."

Miraculous: "Could you do it or not?
You did it.
You bumped into the wall with your broadside full.
You didn't ask what you could do to get out of here.
Only what you could do."

Sigur gasped for air.
He clenched his fist.
Read them off again.
Then his face went close to Miraculous and breathed in.
Miraculous pressed himself against the wall, panicked and suddenly he spat Sigur right in his face and fled under him into the opposite corner.

Sigur wiped the spit from his face in disgust, jumped up, turned around and shouted with a clearly redder face: "YOU ...". Then he stopped, breathed out and looked at Miraculous questioningly.
He looked.
He looked back.
Blinking his eyes.
Sigur kept looking.
He breathed quietly.
One minute, two minutes.
Suddenly a quiet "Pling!" sounded at the end of the corridor behind the bars.
A hand-sized, colorfully glittering painted glass sphere jumped towards them, how naturally she jumped without bumping through the bars and towards Sigur.
He instinctively opened his hand, and the ball jumped in.
It shone vividly in various shades of blue and green.
Sigur looked at her in wonder.

Sigur: "What is that?"

Miraculous: "But today they are gracious to you.
That went pretty damn fast."

Sigur: "What is that?"

"A magic ball, what else?"

Sigur: "And what can you do with it?"

Miraculous: "Throw against the wall, for example."

Sigur looked at him.

Miraculous: "No, really now.
You have to throw it in a place where it could have meaning, and then it will turn that place into something meaningful."

Sigur: "In what?"

Miraculous: "In a window, for example."

Sigur threw the bullet against the wall.
In an instant, everything was atomized into millions of small, glowing dust spots that slowly sank to the ground and disappeared into nothing there.
Behind you appeared a barred window with a magnificent view over a sun-flooded landscape.

Sigur: "Wow!"

He went to the window, grabbed the bars, and looked outside.
He smiled and nodded his head wonderfully.
"Well, that's the first step.
Something's going on here.
I should have taken the other side, we'd have the sun in the room by now."

Miraculous: "Yes, I knew that."

Sigur without any tension: "Why didn't you say so?"

Miraculous: "Because you didn't _question_.
You people always think you're the smartest people in the universe.
I can tell you: Nah, it's not like that.
I'm telling you, holey thinking wherever you look.
I've seen people around here slower than you.
I'm serious.
And others were more stupid, more imprecise in their thinking.
Although... maybe not."

Sigur closed her eyes and breathed calmly.
The anger rose again in his chest.
How could this little rat bring him so quickly to the edge again and again?
His chest pounded.
He put his hand on it.

Miraculous: "You know, you're just not used to it.
I'm an opera rat, the only species mentioned in the book Cypherpunks.
People can't think of anything we opera rats can't overcome.
We always find a way in.
And that's hard for her to bear.
Because they think they're superior to us.
But you're not.
And that's why you're reacting so violently.
You're really angry.
You tried to murder me.
And all because you can't stand the fact that I know more than you do."

Sigur looked at Miraculous seriously and calmly.
Then he went back to the window and checked the bars and joints of the window.
Everything seemed solid.

"Pling," it came back from the end of the corridor, and another bullet jumped at her.
Sigur held out her hand, and she jumped in.

Miraculous: "That's great.
Now we have the sun in our room!
Throw it here!"

Sigur: "Really?
Can't we do something better with it?"

Miraculous: "Sun.
Vitamin D.
It's food.
That's important in a dungeon like this.
Who knows how much longer we'll be in here.
And there will be guaranteed sunshine.
And it's good for your mood and your skin, too."

Sigur threw the ball at the opposite wall and in the same way a barred window appeared.
The sun dazzled him immediately.
He held his arms in front of his eyes.

Sigur: "Ah, nice.
That's good in the dark hole."

Miraculous: "Did I tell you the sun is coming?" He grinned broadly.

Sigur looked at the door: "What would have happened if I had thrown the ball there?"

Miraculous: "What do you think?
Then probably the door would have jumped open, and you could have walked out.
I don't understand why you didn't do this.
I would have?"

Sigur looked at Miraculous disappointed: "Oh, come!"

Miraculous: "Yes, of course.
Doors are usually the place to go out and in.
And a magic ball always does something useful, something that goes on.
I even told you that.
So I threw the magic ball on the door the first time and didn't just make a few useless windows."

Sigur put his hands in his face.

Miraculous: "What's wrong?"

Sigur cool: "Nothing.
I'm just getting to know you."

"Pling," it sounded from the end of the corridor, and a red-gold ball jumped along the corridor, through the bars, into Sigur's hand.

Sigur grinned at Miraculous and threw the bullet at the door.
She destroyed like the first two, and in the cloud, the bars turned into blue shimmering light bars.
Sigur went to the bars and carefully checked them with his finger.
He was gently pushed back.
He pushed harder and was pushed back harder.
He turned around and looked at Miraculous.
He shrugged his shoulders and looked back with innocent eyes.

Sigur: "Come on, I know you know how to get through."

Miraculous nods: "Yes, I know that.
But the way you're on it, you're not gonna believe me.
And don't do anything at all."

Sigur: "Tell me.
And no more games.
I want to get out of here now."

A little shamefaced, wonderfully: "Okay.
Then I'll tell you.
But you shall not throw the stone at me."

Sigur: "I'm not."

Miraculous: "Promise!"

Sigur: "Promise."

Miraculous: "You have to take a run-up from here and then jump through with full speed and power."

Sigur closed his eyes.
He opened it, looked at Miraculous, and said, "I can't believe it!"

Miraculous: "I mean what I say, I mean everything I say."

Sigur: "If I do that, will I get out of this dungeon, or will it just knock me back?"

Miraculous: "Through!"

Sigur: "Out or back?"

Miraculous: "Out."

Sigur pulled himself together, went to the other end of the dungeon.
He looked at Miraculous and said, "And what's behind it?"

Miraculous: "I don't know.
It's late.
A little earlier would be behind it the 3.
Sphinx.
But it's late."

Sigur: "What does late mean?"

Miraculous: "If you had thrown the first bullet correctly, there would have been the Sphinx."

Sigur took a running jump and jumped on the grate with all his strength.
A flash of light enveloped him, he felt weightless for a fraction of a second, he flew and landed in the Cypherpunk Caf√© on the floor, directly in front of the table where Lasse was sitting.
He bent down, patted Sigur on the shoulder and said, "Hi!
What took you so long?"
