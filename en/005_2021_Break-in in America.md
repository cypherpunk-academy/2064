## **2021** Break-in in America

<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Marlene pulled a scribbled note</span> out of her pocket.
He had everything on him that she needed now.
The last piece of the mosaic on the lower left was only added yesterday.
Two words.
"karlibender" and "LV7jolgS7brT5M", name and password, and she knew where they fit.
The way there was a little trip around the world, but it wouldn't take long.
She began the journey by logging on to a Berlin university computer with an account that no one had used for a long time.
From there it went on to New York, a side trip to Brazil and then to New Jersey to Princeton University.
There Karl Bender and other scientists worked on a project in which American secret services also participated.
It was about satellites, spy satellites, top secret, of course.
Everything, even the project name, was classified.
But Marlene knew about it.

Karl Bender had a girlfriend, Corinne, and she had been Marlene's best anonymous girlfriend for years.
That is, they had never actually met and had had no contact with each other that anyone could know about.
They had met protected in the Tor network, in a chat room, and both had over the years taken great care that they always met anonymously, always protected by Tor masks.
They talked about each other, more and more about themselves.
Then they could research the Internet and find out whether it was really true what the other had said.
And so, as time went by, they began to trust each other more and more and began to tell each other everything about each other.
It was just exciting to have such an anonymous relationship.
In the meantime they knew each other very, very well.

Corinne had told her that an NSA intelligence officer had visited Karl to prepare the launch of a completely new satellite.
The NSA was a secret service of the American Army, it was the largest secret service of all.
And on that visit, almost everything went wrong.
Nothing worked right away and they would have had to abort the start by a hair of their fingers.
But together they just managed to finish a program that had to run on the satellite, literally at the last second.
Probably in the hectic pace of life, the NSA man had deposited the secret key for his own computer with the NSA on Karl's computer.
And then forget it there.
A Secret Service key! Karl had told this to Corinne one day later on a walk.
Actually, he should have deleted it immediately, but he hadn't done it.

When Marlene heard about it, she immediately began to investigate.
Her brother Marwin was a famous Cypherpunk.
Cypherpunks were hackers who wrote encryption programs and distributed them free of charge to anyone who wanted them.
They were the best programs there were.
Even the greatest secret services had respect for them.
Marlene had often sat next to him for nights when he was sitting in his radio-secured basement and traveling around the world, and she had learned a lot in the process.
Marwin also often took the time to explain things to her, show her past hacks or teach her a programming language.
She could always come to him with anything, he had said, anytime.
And she had also thought of asking Marwin for help on the matter.
That would make a lot of things easier, but then she decided not to.
Anonymous relationships are anonymous relationships, period.
This key was for her, for her alone.

"k a r l i b e n d e r" type it after the word "login" into the console.
"Password:" the computer replied.
Now it got exciting for the first time: "Was the password changed in the meantime?"

"L V 7 j o l g S 7 b r T 5 M" and then the Enter key.

<div style="background-color: #222; color: lightgreen; padding: 20px; margin: 20px 0; font-family: 'Courier New'">

"karlibender@trt.princeton.edu: $$",
</div>
appeared on the screen.

"YES!" she shouted loudly and immediately looked across the town hall square.
Nobody seemed to have noticed her.
She was inside! Not a great news item.
Only the command input of the terminal program, but this time from Karl Bender's computer at Princeton University.
Whoa! Your fingers scampered over the keyboard.
How automatically she collected all the log files she could find, all the password files and all the key files.
Your brother always did that first, too.
Through the log files, she could find out what was happening on the computer, listed in detail, and from the password files, if you were lucky, you could decrypt individual passwords if they were poorly protected, for example if they were too short or contained words from dictionaries.

She quickly looked to see if there was anything from the day of the satellite launch and actually, that was it.
Then she terminated the connection with Karl's computer, she didn't want to stay in too long.
She clicked on "Change identity" to get a new disguise from Tails.
And a third of a second later she was on the Internet someone completely different.
Nothing reminded her of the disguise she was wearing on Karl's computer.
She breathed deeply.
Now she could look through the files she had captured in peace.

She discovered the key to the NSA man quickly.
He was lying quite open with the other keys.
But where did it fit? Which computers outside the university did Karl and the NSA man access that day? That was the question.
And after some browsing she had found traces of seven computers, four of which led to other universities.
So there were three left.
Your addresses were:

<div style="background-color: #222; color: lightgreen; padding: 20px; margin: 20px 0; font-family: 'Courier New'">
23.66.234.12

23.66.177.120

23.66.177.121
</div>
Internet addresses of computers consisted of numbers separated by dots, often four numbers between 0 and 255.
Every computer on the Internet had such an address, you could reach it through it.
Most of them also had readable names, such as www.torproject.org or www.google.com.
But not this one.
And she couldn't track where the data she sent to those addresses went either.
On their way there, they disappeared into a dark Internet cloud.
Marlene had no idea where the computers with these addresses were, what kind of computers they were.
She thought for a moment and then opened a chat program.
Her brother was online and she typed the three addresses with three question marks behind them.
Nothing else.
After a few seconds, her brother disappeared.
Without answering.

"Hmm," she thought.
"If you ever need him... All right.
Then I'll just have to get on alone." She started searching the Internet for clues.

"Pling" sounded from the laptop a few minutes later.
Your brother was back online.

"Have you gone crazy?" appeared on Marlene's screen.

Marlene trimmed.
What's going on now?

Marwin: "CHANGE YOUR TAILS IDENTITY!"

She clicked on "New Identity" and Tor gave her a new disguise.

Marlene: "Okay."

Marwin: "You can't just send such addresses without knowing what computer I'm sitting in!"

"How do I know which computer my brother's sitting in right now?" Marlene thought.
"Bullshit."
Marwin was always in tails with a mask on, without exception.
She had always been able to write to him without thinking where to go.
She didn't understand.

Marwin: "WHERE DO YOU HAVE THE ADDRESS HER?"

Marlene burst her collar and said, "Will you stop screaming?"

Marwin: "NO.
I CAN'T.
WE MUST SPEAK, QUICKLY, WHERE ARE YOU?"

Now she finally felt like a little girl.
And this with her brother, with whom she would have expected the least of all.

Marwin: "SAG NOW!!!"

"NIRGNDWO!!!!!!!!!!", type it into the chat window and close it.
Then she closed the laptop and looked across the square.

"The address!" she thought.
"He said the address.
It's only one of the three." She looked at the addresses.
"It must be the first!"

The longer she waited, the greater the probability that she would not get into the NSA computer.
Corinne said she would go fishing with Karl over the weekend and they wouldn't have a smartphone and a cell phone with them, but there were others at Princeton who could intervene if something seemed strange to them.
She opened her laptop and went the same way as the first time: Berlin - New York - Belo Horizonte - New Jersey, Princeton.
She entered her name and password.
Back in! She took a breath.

"Go on!" she thought and typed:

<div style="background-color: #222; color: lightgreen; padding: 20px; margin: 20px 0; font-family: 'Courier New'">
&lt;font color="#ffff00"&gt;-=randw@23.66.234.12=- sync:ßÇÈâÈâ
</div>
Her heart pounded.
ssh that were only three letters, but a key to unlock other worlds.
You could jump from one computer to the next.
And now she might have jumped into an NSA computer.
"randw" was apparently the NSA man's name, at least that's how it was in the log files.
She pressed the Enter key.

<div style="background-color: #222; color: lightgreen; padding: 20px; margin: 20px 0; font-family: 'Courier New'">

</div>
She could barely breathe.
Her heart was beating palpably.
She was inside! In an NSA computer.
For the first time in her life.
So easy.
The key worked.
Like in a trance, she copied all log, password and key files, then tried to cover her tracks as best she could.
Her fingers rushed wildly across the keyboard.
She always said that she could definitely type faster than she thought and that was really the case here.
Then she logged out again and landed on Karl's computer again.
Everything together had lasted no more than 30 seconds.
She didn't even know what city the computer she had just been in was in.
Maybe Fort Meade, where NSA headquarters were.
She had sweat on her hands.
Then she carefully erased all traces on Karl's computer, and pulled the USB stick out of the computer.
Everything she had collected was now on a little stick.
She embraced him in her hand and leaned back.

"Hello Marli," said a voice from the side and a young man sat next to her.

"OSKAR!" Marlene looked at him, then away and back again.
"What are you doing here?"

Oskar was a good friend of her and her brother.
He was also a cypher punk.
From him she had received the computer she had just been using at NSA.
Like Marwin, he was also under direct supervision of at least two government agencies.
Maybe even from the Americans.

"Good place," Oskar said as he looked around, "anonymous Internet and no surveillance camera if you squeeze against the wall."

Marlene: "What are you doing here??? Shit! Shit! Shit! My brother sent you?"

Oskar nodded.

Marlene: "Shit! Am I being watched by my own brother now? And... how did you find out where I was?"

Oskar: "Everything's okay.
We don't have much time.
I need you to go to The Bird in Kreuzberg.
Sit down there at the free table in the first back room and order two hamburgers.
About 20 minutes."

Marlene: "I will be a shit.
Just because you say that? Why would I do that?"

Oskar: "I don't know."

Marlene looked at him in astonishment.

Oskar: "All I know is that it's a matter of life and death!"

He looked at her seriously.
In Marlene, he never let go of his eyes.
She struggled with the rage that rose in her, her face turned red.
Oskar looked back seriously and calmly.

Oskar: "Go now ... but slowly.
And don't go directly, but buy something first."

Marlene slowly got up and walked down the stairs without turning around again.
