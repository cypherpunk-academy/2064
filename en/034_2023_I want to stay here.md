## **2023** I want to stay here

<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The woman looked </span> at Marwin with confidence: "We want to make you an offer you can't resist."

Marwin didn't pull a face.

Frau: "You can get out of here today and fly to Berlin.
With official entry permit from Germany.
You get â‚¬50 000 in cash for a fresh start and no restrictions on your Internet activities."

Man: "And that's very unusual.
Normally that would mean: "No Internet for at least five years."

Marwin moaned slightly.

Frau: "And safety from prosecution by German criminal authorities.
Full amnesty.
You'll get a fresh start.
You can live a normal life, start over."

Marwin looked at her for a while and said, "And what do I have to do?"

The woman inhaled: "Not much.
We're doing a joint story on what happened in those two years.
Wait a minute! Wait a minute! Don't refuse immediately.
We can't just let you out of here like this.
That wouldn't work.
Even if I just wanted to let you go, I couldn't do that.
There are very, very powerful people out there who are watching exactly what is happening here, and they have already made an unusually large number of concessions.
Otherwise, you and I wouldn't be sitting here.
We have to give them a little.
The world isn't perfect.
I think you're innocent.
You have nothing to do with what you were arrested for.
I would release you directly.
But that's not the reality."

Man in slightly threatening tone: "If you don't cooperate with us, others will come and talk to you who want other things.
Or nobody anymore.
That's not in our power.
We're here now.
This will open the window for some options.
But not for long either."

Marwin to the woman: "Why do you come now? And don't give me that shit.
Something's happened.
That's why you're here.
You're expecting benefits from letting me out.
What's that?"

Man impatient: "You get a chance.
We really don't have much time.
If we both leave here with no result, maybe we won't come back..."

The woman interrupted him: "Wait.
Mr. Farras, you're right.
I understand you think it's a trap after everything you've been through.
But it's not.
And there's actually a trigger for this conversation.
But again, I can't tell you everything, I can't.
As much as I wanted to.
Just this much: There was a rethink at the highest level, in the government, with the president, regarding everything that has to do with surveillance.
They're talking about dissolving the NSA." She looked at him insistently.
Marwin looked back slightly absent.

Frau: "You can imagine that there is a lot going on in our country.
And in the course of that, prisoners are also released.
Especially the innocent." She lowered her eyes to the table.

Marwin: "Where's Marlene?" He looked at the woman insistently.
She was slightly startled, looked at Marwin, but quickly touched herself again: "She is well, as far as I know.
She's free."

Marwin crossed his arms: "I want to stay here."

The man moaned.
He reached for his bag.
The woman looked at him.

Frau: "I don't believe you."

Marwin: "You're lying to me.
They just got scared at my question and didn't answer it.
I want to stay here!" His voice vibrated slightly.

The man grabbed the woman by the arm: "Come! I told you it was no use.
He's resistant to reason.
We'll tell them to send in the others.
Meanwhile, we'll continue with Sudo."

"Sudo's here!" Marwin was aghast, but then he immediately rebuffed.
"Doesn't interest me, doesn't interest me." The man had already started to say something.

Marwin: "I don't want to know anything about Sudo."

Man: "Sudo lost one leg."

Marwin froze.
"Fucking manipulations," he thought.
"How am I supposed to get that out of my head now: Sudo hasn't lost a leg.
Sudo hasn't lost a leg.
Sudo hasn't lost a leg." He laid his head on the table and buried it under his hands.
The man and the woman looked at him.
After a while he straightened up, looked into the room apathetically and started humming quietly "Allways on the bright side of life".

The man grabbed his folder and left the room.
The woman looked at the table in front of her for a while, then at Marwin again, and then followed him.
