## **2023, 1918** Interrogation (2)

<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">A dirty street café</span> in a shopping street somewhere in Addis Ababa. Marlene was sitting in a corner, halfway behind a column, drinking tea.
Two native young men with black sunglasses looked over at her from a neighboring table. She looked away, reached into her backpack, and took out the paperback. She was just about to start reading when suddenly a platform truck stopped, and men in uniform and sunglasses jumped down. Three of them stood in front of the café with their submachine guns in front of them. On the other side of the street, something similar seemed to be going on.

Marlene proud. She watched closely what was happening, put one hand on her backpack.

"No problem!" shouted one of the young men from the next table. "It's just the Home Secretary, he wants a cup of coffee over there."

Marlene nodded to him and then delved back into her book.


### Vault cellar.

Hilde gagged again, still on the same chair.
The captain's standing next to her.

He bends down to Hilde, goes very close to her ear with his mouth and whispers half loudly:
"Well?
You know what's next, don't you?
Don't you want to spare yourself that?
And Wilhelm, too?
I'll tell you the price: You choose one of the boys here who is allowed to take you in.
They're all hungry.
Then you write the names down for me.
If the names are right, you can go home and cook a plate of noodles.
Maybe take a shower first... Hmm?
How's that?
...
Yeah, I know, it's a little more expensive than before.
But that's how it is in life, the longer you wait, the more expensive it gets."

Hilde shows no emotion.

"Klock!", the door jumps open, and two of the soldiers drag in a man who pedals his legs powerlessly.
They put him on a chair about ten meters from Hilde so that she can just see him from the corner of her eye.
He can barely hold himself upright on the chair.

Hilde looks over and thinks, "Oh, no.
Wilhelm!
What have they done to you?"

Wilhelm takes no notice of her.
She's breathing: "What's next?"

The captain bends down to her again: "Your brother's here."
He's got a big grin on her face.

"I can still see you walking down the avenue, hand in hand, so merrily...
Then he put you on his shoulder.
It's not so romantic now.
I see what you mean.
But no matter.

I have another problem now.
I have to decide how I'm going to wind this thing up.
I want the list of names.
You both know them.
So I have to decide: Who gets the special treatment and who's gonna tell me the names?
Hmm.
Hilde or Wilhelm?
Wilhelm or Hilde?"
He swings his hand back and forth.

"Wilhelm!
Wilhelm gets treated, and you tell me the names.
Okay?
He shouted out, "Phase one."

A soldier approaches Wilhelm from behind and hits him on the head with a broken broom handle.
He's moaning out loud.
"Rumms," again.
The soldier takes the stick to the other side of the head and strikes again.
Wilhelm moans loudly again and then whimpers quietly.

Captain: "Well?
Abort?
I mean, you know we can do more than that.
You Spartacists must have talked about it before.
Oh, I see. You can't talk.
Berthold!"

Berthold comes and takes off her gag. Hilde coughs and spits on the floor, but doesn't answer.

Captain: "Hmm.
Isn't it?
Okay, then it's phase two.
And you choose two boys.
It's getting more expensive.
I told you."

"Wait, Captain.
I have an intermediate layer," calls Berthold.

Captain: "Intermediate insert?
Good.
You always have pleasant interludes."

Berthold slowly approaches Wilhelm from behind.
Then he opens his trousers, grabs his penis and pisses Wilhelm over his back and shoulder with a wide beam, accompanied by loud laughter from all the other soldiers.

Captain: "Joah.
Good deposit!
That'll help.
But it smells terrible, all the way over here!
Don't do things like that too often.
But now: Phase 2.
All but Berthold leave the room."

The room empties.
Berthold goes to a shelf on the wall in which there are some pliers and knives.
He looks for a while and then takes a big little pair of pincers.

Berthold: "The toe and finger forceps." He's holding it towards the captain.
Hilde looks over at him, closes her eyes again and breathes heavily.

Captain loudly: "First the fingers, first the thumb," then he looks at Hilde: "Well?" Hilde's breathing harder.
She's starting to sweat.

Berthold: "Thumb?
That's good."
He takes Wilhelm's hand.
He's fighting back.
Berthold grabs harder.
Wilhelm snatches his hand from him with his last strength.

Berthold: "Well, you don't want to?
No problem."

Berthold sits down on his lap with a swing so that he wedges Wilhelm's arm under him.
He takes his hand by force.
Wilhelm can't do anything anymore.
He's trying to pull her away, but he can't.
Berthold uses pliers.

Hilde: "STOP!"

The captain introduces himself: "Stop?
Okay, who do you want to fuck?
Should I call the boys back in so you can choose?"

Hilde: "Give me a piece of paper and a table.
I'll write the names down for you."

Captain: "One by one.
The boys here are so looking forward to it."

Hilde says, "I need a table, a piece of paper and a pencil."

The captain thinks briefly.
"Okay.
Then we'll change the order.
First the names.
It's better that way anyway.
Then you're still fresh when you write.
Come on, table over here!"

Berthold carries the table to Hilde, she gets a pencil and the sheet on which already "Wilhelm Papenburg" with his address was written above.
Berthold opens her handcuffs.
She breathes deeply and begins to write.

Marlene closed the paperback and looked at the three submachine gunmen.
Then she pulled a laptop out of her backpack and turned it on.

"Pling!" it came off the speaker. Marlene taps the keyboard and smiles.

Marlene quietly: "Lago Maggiore? Yah."
