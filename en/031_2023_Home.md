<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Marwin sat in</span> a windowless meeting room at a table.
Opposite him sat a man and a woman in business clothes.
Two soldiers stood in the two corners behind him, another with his legs apart, with his arms crossed in front of the door.

"Marwin Farras!" She nodded to him nicely.

Marwin was speechless.
He hadn't heard his name in two years.
And now here.
He shook his head.
Shake again, then nodded.

Frau: "What now? Are you Marwin Farras?"

Marwin: "Yes, I am." or "Did you finally find my file card after two years?" In the past, that would have been irresistible to him.
Now it didn't fit him anymore.
He had lost the taste for such humor.
He looked at them both and tried as hard as he could to understand why they had come here and wanted to ask him questions.
They really seemed to want something.
That was new.
A lot of it was new today.

Frau: "How are your health?"

Marwin turned his head and pointed to the spot with the blood crust.
Then he pushed his lower lip down and showed a gap with three missing teeth.

Marwin: "Knocked out." He looked at her a little away.

The woman moaned quietly, "Can you walk?"

Marwin: "Running, sitting, peeing, jumping, standing on one leg.
I haven't tried dancing in a long time.
Scream! May I, please? Why am I being held here? What do you want from me?"

Mann: "We want to determine her state of health in order to prepare a possible release."

Marwin turned to him and looked at him in astonishment.
That's the last thing that would make sense to him.
Release him? With everything he'd experienced here? With all the contacts he had in the past, who still trusted him, and whom he has learned some new things about the reality of 21st century hacker prosecution, he has been able to make a lot of progress.
I could tell you about in the middle of the 20th century.
Including torture.
No! That was the last thing they could want.
A trick? I might.
No, I guess not.
He decided not to say anything.

Man: "You want to get out of here? Do you want to go home?"

Marwin looked at the man absently and remained silent.
"Home ... to Marlene ... to her parents ... to Berlin," he thought.
A tear was squeezing out from within and began to fill the right eyelid.
"Don't let on".
He folded his hands in front of him on the table and closed his eyes.

Frau: "We know you've had some bad experiences.
But it can be over now.
I read her file.
I know what you've been through.
Light deprivation, sleep deprivation, unfair beating, standing naked in the cold in the mud.
You had pneumonia." Marwin opened his eyes and looked at her.
She continued, "Wrong news: Arrest and death of her sister..."

"Mari!" it burst out of him.
He looked the woman in the eye.
He looked again.
"The message wasn't real at all! He trusted her.
It was a lie," he thought.
"Shit, I didn't think the message could be wrong." He was looking wild.
"Marlene's not dead?" he asked the woman quietly.
His heart started beating.
How could he believe that? Why on earth would he believe those assholes? What's the matter with you? He jumped up, tore at the handcuffs, which clashed like in a medieval dungeon dungeon dungeon.
Then he screamed as loud as he could: "Pigs! Bastards! Assholes!" The two men behind him grabbed him and pushed him onto the table.
One of them pulled out a black tape with one movement of his hand and tore off a piece.
The other, meanwhile, was holding Marvin's head ready.

Woman: "Stop! Stop! Stop! No tape.
Nobody dies when he screams.
Go back to your corners!"

Marwin was crying on the table.
He whimpered, "Pigs, pigs, pigs."

The man and woman looked at Marwin for a while as he lay with his hands over his head on the table, and then looked at each other.
The man shrugged his shoulders, reached for his folder on the table and wanted to get up.
The woman held him by the arm.

Woman: "Hold on."

He sat down again.

After a while Marwin looked up and wiped the tears from her eyes.
The woman slipped him a pack of paper tissues.
He ignored her.

Marwin looked at her and said, "Where's Marlene?"

The woman looked down briefly: "I know that this is infinitely difficult to bear.
But we've got to get through this now.
Mistakes have happened.
Bad mistake.
There will be an investigation..."

Marwin interrupted: "Where one never learns what came out of it, who did what, why, and why he or she should no longer do that."

Frau: "There will be an investigation.
I know the United States law enforcement system is far from perfect.
But it's the best we got.
And we've corrected a lot of mistakes.
Today we may be able to correct another one."

In Marwin, rage rose again, infinite rage.
But this time he could hold her.
She didn't overpower him.
Marlene was alive.
It gave him new strength.
After asking where Marlene was, he had seen in the woman's eyes that she knew her and perhaps even knew where she was.
"God!" a thought ran through him.
He stopped breathing.
"They want Mari.
And they need me for that... No! No.
No, they won't get that.
I'd rather die.
I'm staying here! If Mari has made it so far, then she has ploughed through the world, then in some places there is no stone left as it was."
He knew her well.
He smiled a little and thought, "You've been messing with Mari ... now you'll just have to see how you get out."
