### Brandenburg Gate
____
Hilde and Wilhelm in an intimate embrace in the middle of the Paradeplatz in front of the Brandenburg Gate.
Around them, the busy hustle and bustle, wagons, people with posters, flags, clubs, a lot of excitement, screaming.

Adolf approaches Wilhelm from behind and pats him on the shoulder.
After a short time, he loosens the embrace and turns to him.

Wilhelm: "Adolf! What is it?"

Adolf: "Here we go."

Wilhelm nodded.
He kissed Hilde on the cheek, and they looked once again, deep into each other's eyes.
Then he followed Adolf through the densely growing crowd towards a small podium.
Adolf jumped up, took the colossal megaphone lying there on a table and started shouting "Heja, heja, heja" loudly.

The crowd slowly turned to him and tuned into the "Heja."
After a while, everyone had turned to the podium.
"F R E E D O M" Adolf yelled as loud as he could.
"F R E E D O M" roared the crowd back.
"P E A C E," another powerful echo.
It reverberated from all sides of the square.
"S O Z I A L I S M."
All fists went up.
The whole place was a roaring sea of billowing signs, flags, and fists.
Wilhelm took the megaphone.

"Comrades!" The crowd kept yelling.
"Comrades! Today is the day..." A man rushed onto the stage, breathless, grabbed Wilhelm by the shoulder, leaned forward panting: "Die, die Deutschnationalen ... dort ..." (The German Nationals ... there ...). He pointed along the long promenade towards Alexanderplatz.
"They're coming!" Wilhelm tried to see something in the distance.
He was frightened, took the megaphone, and yelled, "SPARTAKISTS! SPARTAKISTS! The German nationalists are coming.
Get out your truncheons.
They don't come in peace." With a big gesture, he pointed in the direction where a crowd of people could be seen about half a kilometer away.
"They are our enemies! But we're not theirs.
But we have to stop them.
With all our strength.
They want to destroy us.
They won't succeed.
FULL POWER ..."

"BEFORE" the crowd replied.
Billets appeared, flags were rolled up, the crowd began to move.
Wilhelm turned to some men standing around the platform to protect it: "You go too! I can manage here."
