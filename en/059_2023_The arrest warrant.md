## **2023** The arrest warrant

<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Anni ran with her smartphone in her hand behind the last row of tables in the classroom.
Sophie followed her, put a hand on her shoulder.
Anni got loose.

Anni: "Such an ass!"
She stamped her foot on the ground.
"I can't believe it!
He did it again!
I thought that was over.
I thought they stuffed the holes now.
I have the latest version of iOS."
She stretched out her smartphone to Sophie.

Sophie took it and looked at the display: "Shit!
He's posting back through your Facebook account.
Shit.
To all your friends.
And such bullshit.
He's got so much shit in his brain.
You really should never have gotten involved with him.
He was an asshole before.
After all, there are no photos this time ... Oh shit ...
Nah."

Anni: "What?"

Sophie: "A photo.
Right now."

Anni: "Give me!"

Sophie kept the phone away:
"No.
Better you don't watch this."

Anni: "But not naked again?"
She snatched Sophie's smartphone from her hand.
"Oh, no ...
no ...
No. No.
She yelled at the smartphone, "You fucker, ass, birdbrain."

She dropped onto a chair, put her head in her hands, and cried.
Sophie carefully put her hand on her back: "Come on, now we're really going to do it.
We'll report him to the principal!
You know, like, police and stuff.
Everyone knows it was him.
He's done it before and boasted about it.
We'll get him."

Anni sobbed, "No, it could have been anyone.
That's another one of the weaknesses of some fucking tutorial on YouTube.
And even if we could get him, the photos are outside.
Nobody's gonna bring them back for me."
Sophie stroked her back.
Anni sobbed, "Why?
Why me again?
Why still?
I thought it was over.
I didn't pick up my smartphone for three months last year.
Until everyone said, there were no more back doors in there."

Kevin joined the two from behind: "Yes, yes, that's what they said:
The most private and secure iPhone ever, transparent, and secure Android phones, like never before.
No more back doors for the first time.
None at all.
Never again.
Apple and Google celebrate their liberation from the intelligence agencies.
Great show.
Thumbs up.
But then they installed new back doors again.
You can't leave it alone.
Maybe they'll be forced.
Throw away your iPhone.
As long as it's not open source, you can forget it."

Sophie pushed him with her elbow: "Hey, you idiot, can't you see: She's in bad condition.
She doesn't need a lecture now."

Anni wiped tears from her eyes: "He is right.
That's what I'm doing now.
Marlene said that a few years ago.
She used to say there were back doors and all kinds of things in there and that they were watching us with them.
Oh, we could use it so much right now.
She'd know what we could do now."

Kevin: "Yes.
She'd hack the stinker.
He would constantly see his picture on every screen at school, for weeks, and never get into his own Facebook account anywhere.
He wouldn't have a good life anymore."

Sophie laughed: "Yes!
Marlene.
That would be cool right now!
...
That's funny.
She never contacted me again.
We were actually good with her, weren't we?
Is she still traveling around the world with her brother?"

Kevin: "I don't know.
The last Twitter messages are more than one year old.
And they were pretty weird.
Just beach and sun, no laptops..."

Sophie: "The parents said that they had problems with secret services and wanted to get used to hacking."

Kevin: "Do you believe that?
Marlene Hacken?
A cat becomes vegan.
Marlene repentantly admits that hacking is not ethical, that one does not do this in our world and becomes "reasonable."
They'd have to torture her or something, brainwash her..."

Sophie: "Mhmh.
You're right, I did.
But then what does she do?
Then where is it?
What about her?"

Kevin shrugged his shoulders, "I don't know."

The door blew open.
Luke stormed into the classroom and positioned himself in the middle: "HEY!
HAMMER!
HAMMER!
Have you heard?
Marlene's wanted internationally on a warrant.
She's supposed to have hacked the vulnerability database!!
It was her!"
He waved his tablet.

The three of them stormed Luke: "Show!
Show me!" They bent over the tablet and read:

* German hacker exposed in NSA spy scandal*

The Berlin hacker Marlene Farras (18) is said to have played a decisive role behind last year's massive revelations about vulnerabilities in computer systems.
She's already been on the run for over two years on other charges.
Yesterday evening, the United States government issued an international warrant for their arrest.
The US accuses her of betraying military secrets that have led to millions of thefts, fraud, copyright, and personal rights violations and, in three proven cases, murder.
She's to be charged under the 1917 Espionage Act.
Should she be sentenced, she expects a life sentence or the death penalty in the USA.

Federal Justice Minister Lamprecht said: "We are against the death penalty and will only extradite it if we get a guarantee from the USA.
Unfortunately, however, the legal situation is otherwise clear in this case.
She didn't work for NSA, so she's not a whistleblower.
She apparently hacked into the NSA and stole the vulnerability database, supported by a larger group of hackers.
This is computer violence, a definite case of espionage.
As far as we know, she was blackmailing money with it first.
When this did not lead to success, she published the database in a completely irresponsible way.
We all know the consequences.
An infinite number of violations of personal rights, property rights, industrial espionage, some companies had to file for bankruptcy. There's evidence of three deaths."

Anni: "Woah.
Whoa.
What kind of idiots are they?
They're gonna blame Marlene for murders.
You're freaking her out?
What's that? What's that?
Sure, I was also thinking about killing the asshole who posted my pictures.
But it wouldn't be Marlene's fault... Are they still all there?
I don't believe this.
What the fuck is this?"

Kevin: "Shit all over my brain.
Marlene Hacken for money?
You can't do that.
They just write that, they don't know about her.
They're so stupid. Marlene won't put herself in danger for money, will she?
Marlene, for money!
They're so blind."

Sophie: "This is pure propaganda.
They're shooting themselves at her.
I can well imagine it was her.
She probably did it to give them a real squeeze.
The ones who put all the weaknesses in there in the first place: Secret services, companies.
And the message seems to have arrived.
She totally got her.
And now she's to spend her whole life in prison for that?
Or worse.
The intelligence chiefs, the corporate bosses, the American president, yes, that would be fair.
But Marlene?"

Kevin: "Kill the Messenger!"

Anni clenched a fist: "Hej, we have to do something.
We can't just put up with this.
That needs an answer.
A loud one.
This can't stop like this!
Marlene's from our class."

Kevin decided: "They must not get away with this.
No way."

Sophie: "We gotta piss right on these motherfuckers' legs."

Anni and Kevin looked a little surprised at Sophie and then nodded.
