## **2064** Vulnerabilities in computers

<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lasse and Sigur sat</span> at the large dining table of the kitchen.
Both with a large cup of thick cocoa in their hands.
Lilly sat cross-legged on the other side of the table, facing toward them, still smiling.

"You prepared that," Lasse snorted at her.
"That went too fast.
That was a computer program, wasn't it?"

Lilly: "Sure! I was writing on it the whole evening yesterday.
This morning I only entered one command and ..."

Sigur: "But how did that work? I had it all sealed up.
I went over everything again yesterday and this morning.
Everything was fine.
Where did you get through?"

Lilly: "A still unknown vulnerability in your firewall.
A large American secret service had it installed and paid a lot of money for it.
It works great.
You can have a look at it after the game in the log files, everything is in there.
First, I'm going to do some more raids with it.
You can get into a lot of computers through that backdoor.
It's widespread, and no one knows it." She grinned broadly.

A <em>software vulnerability</em> or <em>backdoor</em> is a way to use a computer differently from how it is programmed to be used.
Maybe a programmer made a mistake, that made his program react in a way he didn't plan for, or he put it in on purpose, like a hidden password, that allows users to do more things.
Secret services pay programers also to build such backdoors for them.
Especially after the year 2001 they started to build backdoors in all aspects of computers and software.
<hint Jacob Appelbaum once meant that if there are 17 ways to enter a computer in a hidden way, than the NSA wants to be able to go all 17 ways./></hint>
It is a very powerful tool, to get into any computer you want.
And there you can do all kinds of things.
Sometimes you can take over a computer entirely from a distance, as if it were your own.
</div>

"That's unfair!" grumbled Sigur.
"You know a backdoor, and you don't tell anyone.
There shouldn't be secret backdoors in the game!
That's stupid!
How can you protect yourself against that?
I really did a lot of work, there wasn't a gap left."

Lasse: "I don't think it's allowed to keep backdoors to yourself at all.
That's against the rules.
Backdoors should be known by the public, they belong to everyone like water and air.
It's a human right... I learned it in my computer administration class.
It's also a Cypherpunk rule. You can even lose your right to work in this field if you don't make a vulnerability known."

Lilly: "Today! Today it is like that.
It was allowed back then. At least, I think so.
In any case, it was totally common."
She smiled.
"I've read an e-mail where someone has offered a unknown vulnerability for sale.
For an awful lot of money.
And somebody bought it."

"Bullshit!" Sigur shook his head.
"Sell vulnerabilities?! Maybe when you're playing Mafia, but not otherwise.
That would be totally corrupt.
Superbad.
That would be as bad as making people sick and then making profit on medicine."

Lilly pulled her eyebrows up.
"Pfff.
Sure, I'm sure.
Hey, wake up!
The world was different then.
Everyone did that back then!
Governments, corporations, intelligence agencies.
They've built whole vulnerability arsenals, as well as weapons arsenals.
They were hoarding them, masses of backdoors."

Both boys went off and snorted.

"Lilly, that's bullshit," Lasse said, still laughing.
"Who told you such nonsense?"

Lilly crossed her arms and made a serious face: "Nope.
I'm serious. Masses, mountains... I'm telling you.
I have..." She stopped.

Lasse made a calming hand move: "Lilly! Be real!"

"You have...?" Sigur asked.
"You have ... what?"
He slipped over to her.

Lilly looked down.

"You found more weaknesses?"
Sigur asked and looked at her intensively.

Lilly looked at him: "Pfffff.
Plenty.
Incredible stuff.
You can't imagine what it's all about," she grinned.
"I found a database at the NSA: 'Zero Day Exploits,' full of vulnerabilities nobody knows yet.
Marie's an agent there. She helped me get to it.
She is allowed to look everything up in the database, but she is not allowed to do anything with it that does not fit her mission, and everything she does and says is recorded.
Everything, every keystroke, every conversation, every facial expression.
They're really recording everything! Of all the employees.
Stupid.
It sucks to work there.
But I could get the database out of there with her help!
It was not quite easy ... And now I can ... Uuuuuhhhhh", she shook her head, "... do so much ... 
Hi, hi.
... I know it's unfair, but it's a game.
You have to be able to lose."

Sigur grumbled: "You work with the NSA? They're enemies.
That's against the rules.
And Marie gives you the information because you're friends in real life, too."

"Not at all.
I cracked two computers for her from hackers. She needs them for her mission.
She has almost finished it.
The two hacker girls just have to be convicted and get more than 10 years.
They are already on trial right now.
When that's done, she's finished the mission.
That was the deal.
We just worked well together as women, we didn't cheat!
You can do a lot of other things, especially a lot of psycho stuff: You can blackmail, recruit, bribe, intimidate, lie.
You know what that world was like?
I mean, how are you gonna get a flying combat robot without having someone in the CIA doing what you want?
No wonder you haven't got one yet.
Marie already has one."

Lasse and Sigur looked at each other.
Flying combat robots.
That was their ultimate goal.
They didn't know anybody who had managed to take one over yet.
Sigur grabbed his stomach and said, "I'm gonna be sick."
Lasse pinched his lips together and looked over to Lilly: "How can you turn someone over, that's working for the CIA?
In the combat robots division?"

Lilly: "I don't know how Marie did it.
But you gotta figure out how they think.
I mean, she has access to all communication data.
She sees what kind of emails someone writes and receives, who he meets or talks to on the phone, what he buys, whether he has enemies, a relationship of which his wife is not allowed to know anything, debts, and then she looks for something that she can blackmail him with.
She apparently found something.
Or maybe someone is just really unhappy with his job.
Then you might be able to recruit him.
Marie, for example, is unhappy, she just got a job she doesn't want to do at all.
But she has to.
And she can't even walk away from there.
You can't just do that in intelligence.
Maybe you can try and recruit her for something.
But then be extremely careful.
You really shouldn't get caught there.
If you do, all hell will break loose.
Half the Secret Service will be after you right away.
And zack you have a rocket in the room and see your medal of honor on the screen.
Like Lars last time."

Sigur: "Lars cheated.
That's why he got kicked out.
Blackmail and all that isn't part of the game.
TRON takes you out of the game when you do something like that."

Lilly: "TRON doesn't.
Marie can access her combat robot at any time and see what it's doing.
And you can't do that without blackmail.
It's clearly part of the game.
That used to be called social hacking. { => Kevin Mitnick}"

Sigur went silent.

Lilly: If you don't want that, you can play Cypherpunks missions.
They are not about taking over as many computers as possible or catching hackers.
They are about revealing secrets, fighting against injustice, and freeing people that were oppressed.
They much more think the way we think today.
And then, maybe you can figure out how the Cypherpunks won the war.
I mean, there were so powerful people against them, secret services, armies, giant corporations.
But in the end, they won the war.
I was wondering if it wouldn't be exciting to play Cypherpunk, too.
Maybe that's the real purpose of the whole game: that we can learn how the freedom war was."

Lasse and Sigur looked at each other.
Lilly wanted to tell them what the real purpose of TRON was, the game they had spent hundreds of hours playing, watching, trying out, learning everything they had come across.

Lasse: "Hej, Lilly.
I've been playing TRON for three years now, and it's all about conquering the world, influencing politics, changing history, but not about freeing the Internet.
I didn't want to play Julian Assange, because I wanted to fight the surveillance system, open up secret services, or make governments transparent.
I wanted to play him because there are a lot of cool people around him who can to a lot of cool stuff, and because half the world is after him."

Lilly: "Well, did you get the part?"

Lasse: "No.
You know that."

Lilly: "You can only get the role of him if you fill out the questionnaire at the beginning in a way that is mainly about the freedom of the internet.
Julian is a Cypherpunk.
If you just want adventure, then you won't get him."

Sigur hissed in between, "HOW DO YOU KNOW ALL THAT?"

Lilly: "I have read Marlene Farras: The Tale of the Cypherpunks before I even started playing TRON.
She writes about 2021 and afterward, until the end of the war.
How it was then, how she learned to hack and later became a Cypherpunk.
And she writes what it really was about, how the people in secret services and in the big companies thought.
And she writes how the hackers were, with white, grey and black hats.
<div style="background-color: #dfd; color: black; padding: 10px; margin: 20px 0; border-radius: 5px;">
The <em>white hats</em> who only research and don't destroy anything, the <em>grey hats</em> who don't have clear boundaries, and who are out for their own advantage and the <em>black hats</em> who really want to steal and destroy.
</div>
And then the hacks they made.
Whoa! That's crazy.
So I thought I'd try out in TRON what I found in her book.
And it was all there in the game.
Exactly like in the book.
Edward Snowden.
That was precisely how Marlene Farras wrote about it.
She also described her own hack, getting the vulnerability database out of NSA headquarters.
And that's what I did with Marie.
It was complicated, but it went exactly the way how had happened in real life.
You need an NSA agent, one who is working at a specific place.
And so we've got out all the backdoors."

Sigur: "All of them? - How many are there?"

Lilly: "I don't know.
It's a hell of a mess.
I can't imagine that they had an overview of it themselves.
There were so many bores and morons working in these secret services.
But there are probably thousands, maybe tens of thousands of vulnerabilities for all the computers you can think of, including satellites.
And a single vulnerability of it is the backdoor that I used to walk into your computers."
She smiled.

Lasse: "You can also give us back our computers ..."

Lilly: "No.
First, Marie already has them, and second, that would be cheating.
You have to run now.
That's how the game is."
