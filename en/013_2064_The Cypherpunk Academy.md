== **2064** The Cypherpunk Academy

<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Edgar spoke more forcefully:</span> "Marlene Farras was 16 years old when she hacked the NSA vulnerability database.
And above all then made it available to all people.
This was a turning point in the liberation struggle of the Internet.
It caused an earthquake all over the world.
Suddenly everyone could see clearly and feel for themselves how many back doors and loopholes there were everywhere on the Internet.
It was full of holes, a lot of people, not only the secret services, could access all the computers they wanted to access.

The Internet had already become a real living space for the young generation at that time.
And when they could understand what was happening in secret, what was being done to screen and categorize them, to get them to buy things, to find things meaningful, or to find unimportant, to withhold things from them, everything changed for them.
These back doors and loopholes were not primarily used for hunting down criminals or terrorists, no, they were used to monitor and control the new generation.
Through these manipulations, many people believed that they needed this and that to have a happy life or not to have a miserable life, they worked for it, spent a lot of time and energy for it, although they did not really need it.
So the new generation was distracted from what they really wanted to do, in their hearts, in their idealism.
Many of them became Cypherpunks at this turning point.

And what Lilly has succeeded in doing, why we all sit here and hundreds of thousands of students from all over the world watch us, is to replay this famous hack.
He was built into TRON from the beginning and waited for someone to find him.
Lilly found it and mastered it on the first attempt."

Yelling in the audience.
Lilly laughed and shone all over her face.

Edgar: "Yes ... And so the TRON game enters a new phase.
And that one's changing.
I can tell you that already.
There is a lot of news, but most of all there is a new rule in the game.
And she's explaining it to you now, Lilly." He beckoned over to her.

Lilly looked into the audience.
"Hmm.
I'm a little excited.
Flattery in the belly area.
Yes ...
... What's the new rule? She's pretty simple.
It says that from now on we can also play all missions as Cypherpunk missions.
Whether you're a secret service agent or a business executive, a politician, a hacker, an American president, whatever.
You can say TRON at the beginning of a game round or sometime in between that you are now Cypherpunk and then you get your points not for domination, money, and control, but for publishing secrets, for compensating for injustices and for creating awareness of how the world actually works."

Lilly looked at Marlene and said, "Marlene, would you like to say something?"

Marlene: "Yes, of course.
As Edgar has already said, the Cypherpunks were not only interested in encryption and open, free software.
It was about a transformation of culture, of how people treat each other.
Encryption was the first step because it allowed us to do things unobserved on the Internet.
The same applies to open and free software and distributed services on the Internet.
We had to make sure that we could work in peace, that we could decide for ourselves what to do on the Internet.
That was the basis.
Without encryption, everything else won't help, then we would be at the mercy of all those who have access to the Internet.
But when we had this, it really started.

We had the ideals of that time before us: power, money, control.
These were the deities of many people back then.
They were worshipped like the gods in ancient times.
It was the most essential thing in life.
That's where we wanted to have other ideals.
For example, the whole world of companies and governments should become transparent.
We wanted to take a step towards real democracy.
Those are the things you want to be if you're going to be Cypherpunk."

Lilly: "And if you want to practice that, if you're going to get to know it in depth, there's a whole new place for you in the game.
And this is really a hammer..." She winked at Marlene.
"Marlene was involved in the programming.
I'll be very curious to hear what you have to say.
I've looked around a little, it's pretty big, and you can do a lot there.
It's... the new... Cypherpunk Academy!
An academy where you can become real Cypherpunks.
And she's somewhere in TRON.
You can find her."

The audience cheered.

Lilly: "It's like a game in a game, it's not easy.
You have to work together a lot and become creative, think, and react quickly.
In any case, it is about the eleven basic ideas of the liberation struggle that you know, i.e., encryption, overcoming oppression, overcoming opposition, unfolding initiative, ...". She stopped and looked back at Marlene: "I read a lot about it in your book.
Can you introduce them?
I would really love that."

Lasse shouted from his seat, "Yes! That would be great."

Marlene nodded, "I'm happy to do it." She turned to the audience.
"But first we'll take a little break, right? The buffet's waiting.
And the food is also essential."
