## **2021** Academi

<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The sun let</span> its last rays shine on the coastline of Saudi Arabia.
Several boats of the Egyptian coast guard crossed at the place where the Hackerspace ship lay on the seabed.
There was a helicopter hovering above them.
An army officer on a boat held Marlene's wet diving suit in his hands.
Next to him stood two Academi soldiers.

Army officer: "Half an hour, no more.
Shit.
But thanks for the tip about the turnoff at the hotel."

First Academi soldier: "You can't get very far.
It was undoubtedly a tourist submarine.
At most until Sharm El Sheik. They will not venture up to Israel.
We've got people all along the coast."

Army officer: "We're getting the satellite data.
What about Saudi Arabia?"
He pointed to the distant shore.

Second Academi Soldier: "For God's sake.
No way. No way.
Saudi Intelligence is everywhere.
And they have all the powers." He smiled.
"And we've already told them.
They don't have any scruples at all about anything.
No, they're not going in there.
That would be suicide."

First Academi soldier: "Sharm El Sheik! You're going to Sharm El Sheik.
He's got family there.
I'm sure that's where he got the boat.
I'll send my men there."

Army officer, "We'll be in touch."
