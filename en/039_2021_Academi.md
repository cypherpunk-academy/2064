## **2021** Academi

<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The sun let</span> its last rays shine on the coastline of Saudi Arabia.
Several boats of the Egyptian coastguard crossed at the place where the hackerspace ship layed on the seaground.
A helicopter hovered above them.
An army officer on a boat held Marlene's wet diving suit in his hands.
Next to him stood two Academi soldiers.

Army officer: "Half an hour, not more.
Shit!
But thanks for the tip with the turnoff at the hotel."

First Academi soldier: "They won't get far.
It was certainly a tourist submarine.
Maybe they get to Sharm-El-Sheik.
They won't dare to go into Israel.
We have people all along the coast."

Army officer: "We're waiting for the satellite data.
What about Saudi Arabia?"
He pointed towards the distant shore.

Second Academi soldier: "For God's sake.
Absolutely not.
The Saudi secret service is everywhere.
And they have all their freedom."
He smiled.
"Besides, we already tipped them.
I can't imagine that she tries to get to Saudi Arabia.
That would be suicide."

First Academi soldier: "Sharm El Sheik!
They will go to Sharm El Sheik.
He has family there.
I'm sure he's got the boat from there, too.
I'll send my men."

Army officer: "We'll keep in touch."
