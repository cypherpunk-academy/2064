## **2064** Sigur

<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Sigur sat in</span> a large, comfortable armchair in the bunker in front of five monitors of different sizes.
One showed WikiLeaks TV, the other various news channels, a switched off combat robot control station, many terminal windows.
Tim stood behind him with his arms crossed.

Tim nodded: "Good text!
That will work.
20 seconds to go.
Does WikiLeaks shoot that right on the screen?
Or do they look at it before?"

Sigur looked back briefly: "I have direct write access.
The screen belongs to me.
I can fade it in, directly on CNN.
It becomes a running text, nice and slow to read.
A little slower than necessary, so that people can twitter on the side.
Another 10 seconds".

Both looked spellbound at the monitors.

Tim: "5"

Sigur pressed the Enter key: "And go!"

BLENDE zur CNN-Redaktion /// On the WikiLeaks and CNN screens, a Guy Fawkes mask appeared above the completely destroyed, smoking NSA main building, and below it began a text that slowly shifted upwards:

<div style="background-color: #222; color: lightgreen; padding: 20px; margin: 20px 0; font-family: 'Courier New'">

YES, WE CAN!


Whoever believed that the hacking power of Anonymous has decreased should take a close look today. Today we attacked and destroyed the center of global surveillance with their own weapons. Let us answer two questions: How did we do it, and why?


At least 78,000 people worldwide have been murdered with flying combat robots in the last 5 years. It is the No. 1 means of oppression with which a worldwide, brutal reign of fear is to be established.


We reject such an approach.


For this reason, we have decided to send a signal with the weapons of the oppressors. We have stolen combat robots, the latest models, experimental combat robots, which, for example, can destroy F22 fighter planes entirely independently. Combat robots that, as you can see, can fly in no-fly zones.


These are special combat robots. They could also fly over Washington or New York, London or Paris, Tokyo, Canberra or Berlin. And they have a special armament with 15 times the explosive power of conventional missiles.


They are not combat robots of the CIA, not of the American Air Force, they are combat robots of a currently still unknown secret service called L B I.


The LBI is everywhere, it operates worldwide. It has no headquarters. Its members all work with second identities: in governments, in companies, in armies, in other secret services, in front companies.

First journalist in front of the CNN monitor: "Here come the crude conspiracy theories."

Second journalist: "Shall we turn that off?"

First journalist: "No.
It's on WikiLeaks anyway.
Then it can work for us too."

<div style="background-color: #222; color: lightgreen; padding: 20px; margin: 20px 0; font-family: 'Courier New'">
Their task is to ensure balance, the balance of hostile groups: in countries, in companies, armies, secret services. Divide et impera is their main motto. Separate people from each other, enemy each other and make sure that there is a constant war between them, a deadly balance, a rainbow war. Just as the rainbow always seems to be in the sky, although millions of raindrops fall, so the people fall in the countries, and the war remains. A balance of death.


Four months ago 122 people died in Kandahar, including seven presidents. It was planned by the LBI as a sham attack by Russian combat robots, which were then to be repelled by American ones, by the famous five-star. This should strengthen America as a protecting power in the region. But the Five Star did not come. It was destroyed by combat robots controlled by us. And so the doom took its course. Nobody was there to stop the combat robots controlled by Mossad, the Israeli secret service, they fired their missiles.


WikiLeaks.org publishes, while you are reading this, all the log files of the attack.


In the course of our battle with the LBI, we also got their Bitcoin treasures: 2.7 million Bitcoins worth US$32.4 billion.


We have distributed ten percent to the open source community, the rest we want to distribute equally among the countries whose presidents were killed in Kandahar. As compensation money. The transaction also takes place in those minutes.


Anonymous.

Sigur jumped up: "Geil. We did it!"
He clapped his hands with Tim and called into his headset: "Lasse, Lasse!
Are you there?"

Lasse with a headset in front of the mountain hut: "Yes!"

Sigur: "Did you hand out the Bitcoins?"

Lasse: "Yes, all gone.
I hope they're confused for a while now so we can survive for a moment.
Otherwise, congratulations.
It went well.
No deaths have been reported yet, and the logfiles and the Bitcoins should be enough for the world to believe the story.
The LBI in Mossad has steered missiles at Arab presidents.
That's already a thing.
There's a lot for some to digest.
I don't want to work for the LBI now."

Sigur: "Especially not if I'm with Mossad at the same time.
I don't know how much they like having a secret service in the secret service."

Lasse: "Political entanglements.
The countries of the seven dead presidents will probably meet soon, and then the Middle East War will probably come.
Shit, too, right?"

Sigur moaned: "Real shit.
They never learn that either.
They'll just hit each other like that.
Because there's no other way.
That's just revenge.
Like little children.
There is nothing you can do.
They are like blind.
And in the end, they detonate the atom bomb ... in self-defense.
They are so stupid.
I could scream."

Lasse: "We're not completely innocent that this is happening now, are we?"

Sigur: "Shit, Lasse!
I'm not the one who's starting the war now.
If it were up to me, you could just shut down the LBI, turn the NSA headquarters into a memorial and turn the CIA into an adventure playground for hackers: a giant hackspace, with the original equipment.
I mean it.
That would be awesome.
Then I would move to Langley for a few years.
And then you'd have to disarm all the nuclear missiles, take away the warhead and then make a giant firework with it, send them to each other in the air.
Or shoot at it with Patriot missiles.
Clay pigeon shooting for professionals.
But what will they do?
They'll make a big crater out of an entire city.
110 meters deep.
They deliberately detonated the bomb on the ground to get the pictures of the crater.
A few hundred thousand people then circled the earth in a cloud of dust for a few weeks."
He hinted at vomiting.

Lasse: "I'm on my way with Roger now.
We'll clean up here and then drive to the meeting point."

Sigur: "Okay.
See you there.
Maybe.
Good luck!

Lasse: "You too!"
