## **2023** The Colonel

<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Marwin was still sitting </span> alone at the table in the meeting room.
He was tinkering with a paper boat.

The door blew open and a U.S. Rangers colonel walked in.
He was about 50 years old, had a sharply cut, rutted face and was tanned. Two officers followed behind him.
He must have sat on the chair directly opposite Marwin.
The first officer next to him on a second chair, the second, briefly looking for a chair, then stood next to the table.

The colonel looked at Marwin, cleared his throat.
Marwin looked at him with slightly astonished innocent eyes.

Colonel: "Farras!
We talked about you for a long time.
We wanted to give you a chance.
We shook hands with you.
They rejected her.
If you had known who you were talking to, you would have had more respect.
What I have learned in my life is to have respect for people, for their performance and for their responsibility.
If these people, these two, would give me an order, then I would obey it without hesitating for a second.

How about you? You made fun of her.
You made fun of it, you gave them the middle finger.
That's why, that's why, right now, you're dealing with me.
That's the price.
If you give me the middle finger, I won't leave the room."

Marvin's face had darkened a little, but he still looked at the colonel with open eyes.
He had not listened to him, but had tried to feel his way into him: "You want to intimidate me, to unsettle me," he thought.
But he now felt immune to it.
He concentrated on thinking, "What kind of person was he? What was his fear? What were his constraints? Where could he not see clearly? What did he see?" A thousand thoughts flashed through his head.
He didn't have to listen to him, that's how much he had learned in the last two years.
The colonel would repeat the things that mattered anyway."

"Yes!" Marwin suddenly thought, "This is it.
He thinks I'm stupid.
He really thinks I'm stupid.
Okay. (laughs)
It can do something."

Colonel: ".... I'm telling you: There's some people out there waiting for you to make the right decision.
They're waiting.
But they won't wait long."

"Wow," Marwin thought, "something really seems to have happened.
But why are they waiting? For what? Me?"

Colonel: "And these people send me in here to see you.
Why, you mean? To talk to you? I am? Pfff.
Talking isn't my strong suit.
I'll tell you what I do in my normal job: I build and manage centers for advanced interrogation techniques for the U.S.
Army in 17 countries.
I set them up, hire a commander and travel around to make sure my colleagues do their job and that they're not afraid of someone getting their asses kicked when they make mistakes.
Everybody makes mistakes.
Believe me, I'm giving those boys out there as much freedom as possible.
They need it for their work.
They can decide what they do to earn the respect and esteem and ... fear of the people in these countries.
And I tell you, the people in the countries there have respect for them, more than for the army, more than for the CIA.
And I'm working on it to keep it that way.
And now... now I'm supposed to talk to you."

He turned to the sitting officer.
"Lieutenant, when was the last time you took anyone out of the game?" He drove his index finger over his neck and smiled slightly.

The lieutenant barked back: "The day before yesterday, sir."

Marwin thought, "Mei, mei.
They didn't prepare that.
You improvise everything.
And they can't do that at all, unplanned, without a strategy.
No, no.
It won't work.
You want my signature on whatever it is.
And they mustn't torture.
I'm pretty sure nothing's gonna happen to me here.
If they could do anything to me, he wouldn't talk that much at all.
I can do something with that.
But what?"

Colonel: "When I tell my boys that I don't want to see you in this world anymore, you can go wherever you want.
They won't find a hiding place.
If you get out of here today and screw up afterwards,
they'd find you.
No matter where in the world, in the middle of the Amazon, the South Pole or the Bronx."

Marwin looked at the two officers politely and thought, "Today? Dismissed? Oh, shit.
That sounds real.
That doesn't sound like a trick."

Colonel, to the standing officer, "Lieutenant, when was your last?"

He barked, "The day before yesterday, sir!"

Marwin nodded to the colonel and said quietly:
"I don't want to get out of here."

The colonel was gasping for air.

"I don't want to get out of here," Marwin must have said.

Colonel with a reddened face: "You're kidding me!"

Marwin shook his head.

Colonel: "Listen! This is no time for games.
Nobody wants to stay in a CIA interrogation center unless they're crazy or stupid.
This is serious.
It's your life at stake.
Turn on your gray matter, if you have any.
Me, here, a U.S. Rangers colonel.
There are two officers of the U.S. Rangers.
You think we'd come if it wasn't serious?
If it weren't for something?
This isn't a game.
We're not playing! I'll tell you frankly and freely what the situation is.
If you get out of here, I'll watch you, personally, I'll fucking watch your fingers.
And if you lead a life like any other person, if you do your work or not, if you have fun, if you don't work against us and if you don't fucking talk shit about what you've experienced here, then I'll just sit here quietly.

I'm being honest with you: I don't like you.
But I'm not gonna hurt you.
Only when you fuck up, when you pee on my leg, I take that personally, I send one of them after you, or a drone.
Does that go inside your little head that this is an offer?
They're coming out.
You'll still get money!" He was gasping for air again.
"And I'll leave you alone.
And don't say that shit anymore that you don't want to get out of here."

"I want the truth!" said Marwin.

The colonel went off and snorted: "Ffffff.
You want the truth.
What's that? Pick one.
We'll make one for you.
You can take them then.
The truth is, if you sign, you come out, stay calm, live your life, have fun, go to work five times a week or not.
Otherwise, you're on my list.
Then I'll rip your dick out." He bent over to Marwin.
"Come to your senses!"

"Would you lie for your fatherland?" Marwin asked, slightly excited.

"If I... if I would lie for my fatherland? Oh, shit.
Boys.
I say it again, you get out of here..." He flicked in the direction of the lieutenant, received a folder and took it.

"If you put your name under this.
Or three crosses for all I care." He put the folder on the table in front of Marwin.
"There are no negotiations here.
If you want to negotiate, I'll take you to another interrogation center, maybe Syria or Iraq.
I've got some rooms where we can negotiate."

"Would you lie for your country?" Marwin asked again.

The colonel's face turned red.
He closed his eyes briefly and then looked at Marwin with an ice-cold gaze.

Colonel: "I..."

He took a short break: "Do you know how it is out there, where it really burns? You have no idea, milk boy.
You sit in front of some computer all day.
But out there ...
If we make mistakes, people die.
It's that simple.
If the people there no longer have any respect for us, many of our men would die.
Would I lie about them not dying? Do you want to say to a mother or a wife or to the little children: Your son, your husband or your father unfortunately had to die because I told some crazy people the truth? The truth must be earned!
People who are not loyal, who stand in my way, who stop me, do not get the truth from me."

Marwin and the colonel looked at each other.

Marwin: "Then lie to me."

The colonel's face darkened.
He leaned back.

Colonel, tense and calm: "If you think you can play with me, with me, then you will get to know me.
There are so many possibilities.
I've got a whole battery of them.
I'm telling you, you're gonna get your act together and sign this document.
And then get her things."
He shoved it at him.

Marwin looked at him and showed him the middle finger.

The colonel held his breath and grabbed his nose.
His face turned turkey red, almost violet.
He breathed out and inhaled a few times, grabbed the document, got up and left the room.
The two officers followed him.
