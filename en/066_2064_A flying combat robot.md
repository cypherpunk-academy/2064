## **2064** A flying combat robot

<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lasse sat up</span> the back seat of a van and worked on his laptop.
They were driving on some highway through Arizona, through the middle of the desert.
Driver and co-driver were engaged in a conversation.

Lasse launched Pond.
He looked spellbound at the screen.
First, the usual message:

<div style="background-color: #222; color: lightgreen; padding: 20px; margin: 20px 0; font-family: 'Courier New'">
>>> There are no messages waiting to be transmitted.
</div>
He typed "log."

</div>
"Wait five minutes. Okay!" he thought.
Pond did not fetch and send messages immediately, but at random times.
It made it harder for secret services to figure out if someone was using Pond.

Lasse: "No, not okay."
He typed "transact now."
After a few moments:

<div style="background-color: #222; color: lightgreen; padding: 20px; margin: 20px 0; font-family: 'Courier New'">
(Jan 14 10:40) Message received from sig
</div>
"Shit. Shit!
It's here: The news from Sig," he thought, "Now it's going to be exciting.
Is he free?"
He typed "show."

<div style="background-color: #222; color: lightgreen; padding: 20px; margin: 20px 0; font-family: 'Courier New'">
Hi, Lasse,

I'm with Tim!!! Yes! I'm out! Everything worked out. This is

But I'm out for now. That's good. That's good. And without persecution-

Tim's house. His grandmother built it. They really did have

No. It wasn't so hard to do, Joe has the system program

I came here with that hitchhiking trick you just pulled

Lasse wrote, "reply."

<div style="background-color: #222; color: lightgreen; padding: 20px; margin: 20px 0; font-family: 'Courier New'">
Hi Sig!

Wow, great! I'm with the Hitchhiking right now at the third
Station. I don't think the driver's LBI. It's a courier.
and obviously has a colleague with him. He's taking me
to Phoenix. That's where Trevor waits. I'll see you in the morning,
I think.
</div>
He saved the message and entered "send".
Pond answered:

<div style="background-color: #222; color: lightgreen; padding: 20px; margin: 20px 0; font-family: 'Courier New'">
>>> There is one message waiting to be transmitted.
</div>
Lasse exhaled.
Two hours to Phoenix.
"Okay," he thought, "it's time to disarm the first bomb and send their Bitcoins back."

He opened the terminal program and connected to the computer in the Tor network where the first bomb was located.
He looked at her: 25 minutes to detonation.
Then he typed:

<div style="background-color: #222; color: lightgreen; padding: 20px; margin: 20px 0; font-family: 'Courier New'">
bbomb --disarm
</div>
The program responded:

<div style="background-color: #222; color: lightgreen; padding: 20px; margin: 20px 0; font-family: 'Courier New'">
Passphrase:

He breathed deeply.

<div style="background-color: #222; color: lightgreen; padding: 20px; margin: 20px 0; font-family: 'Courier New'">

"It's that simple," he thought. "Okay, now wire it back."

<div style="background-color: #222; color: lightgreen; padding: 20px; margin: 20px 0; font-family: 'Courier New'">

The moment he wanted to press the enter button with his finger, the car was driving over a bump.
Lasse made a sentence up together with the laptop.

"Sorry!" said the driver from the front.
"I didn't see them."

The command in the terminal program had disappeared.
Lasse presses the up arrow button to retrieve it.
He wasn't there anymore.
Lasse looked around the car irritated.
He typed the arrow key a few more times: nothing.
He didn't understand.
Orders couldn't just disappear like that.
He looked around, his gaze went outside, then forward.
They were heading for a bend with a hill behind them.

"OOOHH SHIT!" he shouted out loud.
Behind the hill, directly in front of them, a flying combat robot floated, slowly turning towards them.
He immediately recognized the model, Reaper MQ-11, at that time brand new, he could stand in the air.
Lasse knew him very well, he was one of his favorite robots, not the fastest, but crazy agile.
His heart began to race.
Twice a short twitch of a fireball on the combat robot.
Lasse instinctively ripped up his arms to cover his face.
Half a second later, two rockets whizzed by to the left and right of the car, 50 metres behind them hit two cars that disappeared in a fireball.
Lasse and his laptop were thrown up again, the driver somehow made the car stop.

"Fuck!" screamed Lasse, "Fuck! Fuck!" He jumped out of the car and looked back at the blazing wrecks.
His heart was racing.
"That doesn't make any sense," he shouted.
He thought, "They'll stop me before they get the money. Fuck! No!
That doesn't make any sense!"

He looked towards the combat robots.
He had no more missiles and turned around.
Then he looked left into the sky.
"Oh!" he thought.
He opened his eyes.
A white giant balloon hovered over the steppe next to the highway, the same as in San Diego over the sea.
Only this time much closer.
It was probably twenty times bigger than normal hot-air balloons.
And it was written on him all over the place:

<div style="background-color: #222; color: lightgreen; padding: 20px; margin: 20px 0; font-family: 'Courier New'">
AK768-X5P

sZEf\~ofUA+
</div>
Lasse stared at him and nodded slowly.
He knew the balloon well.
It came from TRON.
But what was he doing here? Now? Now?
It was a clue for him.
The bump had prevented him from sending the Bitcoins.
The combat robot was an intimidation from the LBI, they had probably become nervous.
It was a little greeting: "We are with you and ready for everything."

"Shit!" he thought, "they kill people for that..."
He grabbed his belly.
"But what is TRON trying to tell me?
sZEf\~ofUA+ is a password, sure.
But AK768-X5P? What the hell was that? I know that from somewhere."
He was thinking.
He walked around the freeway a few times in a circle.
"Yes! Sure! It's a satellite."

He jumped in the car and typed something on his laptop.

"This must be the satellite the LBI uses to control the combat robots."
He thought, "We found him. Finally!
And an access to it right away.
Sigur must know that.
Right now.
Then we can hunt them down.
It's gonna be a thing.
Yeah, they showed up.
Now we find their combat robots.
This is gonna be fun."

He smiled and typed.

<div style="background-color: #222; color: lightgreen; padding: 20px; margin: 20px 0; font-family: 'Courier New'">
Hi Sig,

The AK768-X5P controls the LBI combat robots. single
was just at 34.513079 / -113.4173765, a new Reaper
MQ-11. Can you find him? I'll get around to it when I'm in the middle of something.
Phoenix changed cars. The password is sZEf\~ofUA+

Lasse.

He waited until Pond had sent the message and closed his laptop.
