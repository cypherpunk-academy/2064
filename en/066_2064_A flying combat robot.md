## **2064** A flying combat robot 

<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lasse sat up</span> the back seat of a van and worked on his laptop.
They drove on some highway through Arizona, through the middle of the desert.
The driver and the passenger were engrossed in a conversation.

Lasse launched Pond.
He looked spellbound at the screen.
First the usual message:

<div style="background-color: #222; color: lightgreen; padding: 20px; margin: 20px 0; font-family: 'Courier New'">
>>> There are no messages waiting to be transmitted.
</div>
He typed "log."

<div style="background-color: #222; color: lightgreen; padding: 20px; margin: 20px 0; font-family: 'Courier New'">
- &lt;font color="#ffff00"&gt;-==- proudly presents
</div>
"Wait five minutes. Okay!" he thought.
Pond didn't fetch and send messages immediately but at random times.
This made it harder for secret services to calculate whether someone was using Pond.

Lasse: "No, not okay."
He typed, "transact now."
After a few moments appeared:

<div style="background-color: #222; color: lightgreen; padding: 20px; margin: 20px 0; font-family: 'Courier New'">
(Jan 14 10:40) Message received from sig
</div>
"Shit. Shit!
It's here: The message from Sig," he thought, "Now it's going to be exciting.
Is he free?"
He typed "show."

<div style="background-color: #222; color: lightgreen; padding: 20px; margin: 20px 0; font-family: 'Courier New'">
Hi, Lasse,

I'm with Tim!!! Yes! I am out! Everything worked out. That is such a super turd there. I really can't believe it. I have a fucking rage. When I meet Fortunato in the dark, I stick a cyanide capsule up his ass. But one with a water-soluble shell. And in the last 30 minutes of his life, I tell him Monty Python sketches, one by one. Such a super asshole.


But I'm out for now. That's good. And without a persecutor. I'm sitting here in a 60-year-old nuclear shelter under Tim's house. His grandmother built it. They were terrified of a nuclear war at that time. Do you believe that? Just like terrorists later on. But now that helps us. No signals come out or in here. Everything is tight.


Joe built me a small clock for my prussic acid capsule so that she always thinks she's connected to the outside world.
And does not release the acid at some point ... my dear little one. It wasn't that hard to do, Joe modified the system program of the capsule. And it actually works, because: I'm still alive. More than 5 hours have passed. Only when I leave here, I have to put on a super funny aluminum costume under my clothes: So that the dear little one doesn't radio home somehow.

 Slowly I wake up, and my head doesn't turn in waves anymore. It's crazy what they give you so you can't think. Better handcuffs than such pills. I think I need a real withdrawal cure, or better Lilly's chili-ginger-garlic diet: for two weeks: Do you remember? In the morning after waking up: slowly chewing two freshly picked and peeled cloves of garlic, keeping your posture and always smiling gently ...


I came here with the hitchhiking trick that you're probably using right now. First I had three random drivers, then Joe, Luis and finally Tim. Six stations. They can't handle it, not when Joe, Luis, and Tim are driving. And since Joe, I had the costume on and the clock.


Now I will chill. Mate stands here before me. When are you coming?


Sig

Hi Sig!

Wow, great! I'm on the third station with the Hitchhiking right now. I think the driver is not from the LBI. He is a courier driver and obviously has a colleague with him. He takes me to Phoenix. Trevor is waiting there. I think I'll see you tomorrow morning.

He saved the message and entered "send."
Pond answered:

>>> There is one message waiting to be transmitted.

Lasse exhaled.
Two hours to Phoenix.
"Okay," he thought, "it's time to disarm the first bomb and send their Bitcoins back."

He opened the terminal program and connected to the computer in the Tor network where the first bomb was located.
He looked at it: 25 minutes to detonation.
Then he typed:

<div style="background-color: #222; color: lightgreen; padding: 20px; margin: 20px 0; font-family: 'Courier New'">
bbomb --disarm
</div>
The program responded:

<div style="background-color: #222; color: lightgreen; padding: 20px; margin: 20px 0; font-family: 'Courier New'">
Passphrase:

He breathed deeply.
