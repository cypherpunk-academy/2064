## **2064** Fortunato

<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lasse and Sigur</span> ran through the streets of Caracas in Venezuela.
It was early afternoon, oppressively hot.
A courthouse appeared at the end of the street.

Sigur: "J u z g a d o? - This is the house where we should go."
He looked at Lasse in astonishment.
"What shall we do in a court of law?"

Lasse: "Let's see."
He looked at a note.
"Second floor.
Room 433.
Up.

They showed their IDs at the entrance, ran up the stairs and sat down on a bench in a dreary corridor.
The massive wooden door to room 433 was closed.
Inside there were very quiet voices.

Lasse looked at his watch and said, "3:31.
Now he wants us to meet him."

Sigur stood up and walked towards the door.
He started knocking.

Lasse: "Stop! We're to wait, they said."

Sigur: "No, it wasn't.
They said, "Meet Frederick Petterson at 15:31 on Avenida Oeste 13, Caracas, Venezuela, second floor, room 433.
We're not in room 433 right now." He started knocking again.

Lasse: "Wait, we..."

The door swung open and a small, sympathetic looking, obviously native man rushed out.
He almost bumped into Sigur.
They both looked each other in the eye for a moment.
The man took a step to the side and hurried past Lasse towards the elevator.

Sigur looked at him perplexed.

Lasse shouted: "Mr. Petterson", although the man didn't look a bit like "Petterson", much more like "Rodriguez".

The man stopped, waited a moment, then turned to Lasse and approached him.
He whispered, "Fortunato, not Petterson, not here."
He looked at both of them wildly.
"Come with me! We must go to a place where we can speak freely."
In the parking lot in front of the courthouse they got into a huge Toyota pickup, an older model, with bumps and scratches on all sides.
Fortunato drove off.
After they had turned from the courthouse parking lot to the main street, he turned to them and asked, "You're hackers, aren't you?"

Lasse and Sigur looked at each other.

Lasse: "Maybe."

Frederick: "You're hackers.
I'm always very well informed.
Must be me.
That's my job."

Sigur: "What are you doing?"

Frederick: "I deal drugs.
But no street vending, no soft drugs.
Just wholesale, just real stuff, just the Internet.
Do you need a ship with cocaine? 500 kilos? Colombia, wonderful stuff.
In two weeks you'll have it..."

Sigur dry: "Yes.
I'd like a ship full of them.
How much is that?"

The smile disappeared on Fortunato's mouth, he answered as dryly as Sigur:
"You're not here for drugs.
You wouldn't have enough money either.
You only have an account with 6500 euros on it, the apartment where you live belongs to your parents and your Bitcoins are currently," he typed with one hand on a somewhat clumsy-looking smartphone, "27.
Whoa! That's a lot for a 19-year-old white-hat hacker.
27 Bitcoins.
Of course you could pay me in Bitcoins, but that's more like 2700.
But as I said, that's not why you're here."

Sigur pushed himself into the back seat with his mouth slightly open.

Lasse: "What are we here for?"

Fortunato: "Hmmm.
That's weird.
I'm supposed to know that.
It's my job to know things.
But, frankly, I don't know."

Lasse: "How do you know how old Sigur is and how much money he has? And that we're hackers?"

Fortunato: "I also know that you illegally fly CIA air combat robots and that you took the Sorat Rangers from heaven.
That, in turn, really sparked my interest in you guys. The Sorat Rangers are history." He smiled warmly.
Fortunato was one of those people you couldn't blame at all.
He radiated warmth and lightness.
They instinctively wanted to trust him.

Lasse thought, "Stop. There's something wrong here.
He can't know all that.
You can't do that.
No one can make that easy the connection between us and the combat robots.
And even know who we were."

Lasse looked at Sigur, then at Fortunato again and asked angrily, "How do you know all this?"

Fortunato smiled again: "I am not only a drug dealer.
You know, it's not really worth it anymore.
The money's right, but it's not enough fun.
It's become so industrial.
They throw tons of the stuff at you, you can order it on the internet directly from the field, you have no risk anymore, but there is no real friendship anymore, is no longer necessary, everything is professional.
And that's boring.
No, I'm trading more and more valuable goods now: Information. Big data.
Great thing, I'm telling you.
I do in individuals and companies, and there everything: whereabouts, bank details, correspondence, pictures, movies.
In real time and the whole history.
In addition, suggestions for blackmail and bribery opportunities.
I don't care who.
I have 230 million individuals in my database.
Do you want the private e-mails from the next president of the United States? No problem. No problem.

I already knew your data in the courtroom.
A sensor told me you were outside the door. You're in my database... But you're wondering how I know where you are. You don't have smartphones. Funny, isn't it? No problem for me. When it comes to whereabouts, I have a specialty, almost a monopoly: "I not only have GPS, but also RFID."

Sigur: "RFID? This is used for payment and access control.
I don't have an RFID chip on me, neither to pay, nor to get in anywhere.
How are you gonna locate me with that?"

Fortunato pulled out a small sheet of paper with a QR code.
"Do you see this tiny skin-colored dot on the other side of the code? That's the world's smallest RFID chip, 78 micrometers long and wide."

Lasse and Sigur leaned towards him, but could not see anything.

Fortunato: "Remember the sweet girls at the entrance to your conference?
The ones who hang your day pass every morning, say something nice and give you a kiss of welcome?
Super cute, huh?
These are my girls.
And they're super smart.
They take one of these leaves, wipe it somewhere against clothing or hair and then register the corresponding QR code.
And you can track where you're going.
Hair's the best.
You don't leave them at the dressing room or change them at some point.
And they get an acoustic signal in their ear if yesterday's chip is still there.
And then you won't get a new one."
Fortunato smiled proudly.

"Asshole!" Sigur mumbled just loud enough for Fortunato to hear.
He stroked his fingers through his hair.

Fortunato looked at him with big, open eyes: "Come on, hey, this is a super system.
And think: I'll tell you this.
You know about it now.
You can't be mad at me for that.
I'm open with you."

Lasse: "And where are all the scanners?"

Fortunato: "In Caracas? All over the city.
We have tens of thousands here.
They cost nothing.
A scanner is a small plate, 15 x 15 millimeters in size and sends via GSM.
They transmit over twenty metres and last about a year." He pulled out a tablet computer that looked like an iPad and grinned: "It's not an iPad, don't worry.
Is something of its own ...
Look!" He showed them a map of Caracas, on which a huge number of red, green and blue dots could be seen.
Some seemed to move, individually, in groups.
A large cloud of dots was visible around the conference centre.

Fortunato: "That's exactly 3243 participants from your conference.
At present, 2230 of them have no GPS phone with them.
But I have the data! In real time!"

Lasse and Sigur looked at the tablet in disbelief.

Fortunato: "Most of them are activists and hackers.
Valuable target group.
And I add information about who meets whom, who eats with whom, who goes for a walk, who goes home.
What do you think I can get for the data? Look, I currently have 24 real-time subscribers." He tapped on the tablet and stretched it out towards them.
"NSA's in there, too.
But I don't take any money from them.
They have so many great things on offer.
I only trade with them, although they keep asking if they can't pay."

Sigur a little louder: "I'm getting nauseous."

Lasse: "You won't get away with this system long, Fortunato.
There are so many RFID scanners at the conference, it's noticeable when suddenly there are a few thousand more chips."

Fortunato: "My chips do not work with the normal frequency.
There's a whole factory in China that only makes my chips.
Hello boys, wake up.
Today you have to do something if you want to be successful.
The world isn't nice.
There's a war out there.
I didn't make it.
But if you know this world, if you know what everything works and what doesn't, then you can still furnish it quite nicely today.
You can do a lot, especially if you don't work for the state, but as a free entrepreneur.
The state secret services and all other services in state hands are really slow and sluggish, even unimaginative: NSA, CIA, LBI, FBI, GCHQ.
All lame asses.
But sometimes damn dangerous lame asses... They just buy what they need.
But they won't get my RFID system.
It's not for sale."

Lasse held his breath.
Sigur looked at him with a slightly panic-stricken gaze, hinting at getting out.

Fortunato: "Hej boys.
We are not as far apart from each other in what we are doing as it may now seem.
Having things under control technically is about dealing with the circumstances in an inventive way.
You know the concept: hacking, converting technology, using something different than the inventors intended.
That's exactly what I'm doing.
Hej, it's also not very moral to steal experimental air combat robots and shoot elite units out of the sky with them.
You caused almost half a billion dollars of damage."

Lasse was grumbling, "I don't do business with NSA."

Sigur hissed to Lasse, "Let's get out of here."

Leave quietly back: "Wait still.
Marlene sent us here."

Sigur very quietly: "I do not make a deal with the asshole.
That's the other side.
He'll lie to you if he has to."

Fortunato unimpressed by the whisper of the two: "But now tell me: Why have you come?"

Lasse: "We are looking for an as yet unknown U.S. intelligence service.
One who is responsible for assassinations, especially for attempted assassinations."

Fortunato gave it some thought.

Fortunato: "LBI.
Lubricious Bureau of Intelligence.
Home of the Sorat Rangers.
Actually, Localized Bureau of Intelligence.
But they're really greasy.
If there are assholes in this business, it's them.
You really don't have to pick on me there.
"Against them, I'm a pure philanthropist."

Lasse: "The Sorat Rangers are CIA!"

Fortunato: "Wrong.
They're not.
Only their badges are CIA.
LBI is all appearance.
That doesn't officially exist.
It doesn't even have its own building.
Nowhere.
None at all.
All employees have a 100% camouflage identity, even the boss.
They don't exist, not at all, they're all over the place: CIA, NSA, government, even foreign intelligence, oil companies, Google, Apple has some ... And you want that? Let me guess what you want from them: You want to steal a combat robot satellite so you can control your own fleet.
You can only get that there.
Anywhere else it would be exposed.
But the LBI has a few that nobody knows about.
Well, am I right?"
He grinned and turned to Lasse.

Lasse: "No."

Fortunato: "No.
Hmmm.
Then you want to be the next Sorat Rangers? That's what you just handed in your business card for.
But I'm telling you, that would be a dangerous game..."

Sigur moaned.

Fortunato: "Okay, okay, I know you don't work with them.
I already learned that.
I don't know why you're limiting yourselves, but okay, you don't do this.
Morale? Morals can be pretty expensive these days.
It could cost her her life.
But then say, what are you going to do?"

Lasse: "We want to uncover the LBI.
We want to make public what they do."

Fortunato braked the car abruptly, drove to the right and stopped, slightly excited: "Guys! That's not a good idea." He turned to them.
"You have seen what a riot the release of the NSA vulnerability database a few years ago was.
Holy chaos.
Big companies went bankrupt.
Many people have completely lost confidence in the Internet.
Heads of government have changed.
People have died."

"No," Sigur interrupted.
"Nobody died because of it!"

Fortunato: "With the secret services, yes, yes, some.
Whatever.
It was an earthquake.
But this one, LBI, that's a little over the top.
It's not just NSA, it's not just an introverted hacker company that leaks into every computer and smartphone in the world and stores all the data it gets its hands on.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
That's more violent.
LBI, these are placed world events, assassinations, blown up buildings, invented rebel groups, invented wars, invented revolutions.
You have no idea what all LBI is.
If you uncover this, a lot of people will die.
Dead sure.
Think about it:
Alone, what would happen if you uncovered Khandahar!
What just went wrong because of you.
Seven presidents dead.
If this turns out to be a fake, there'll be a war.
Dead sure.
A war with many dead.
And that was you.
That's not very moral.
You're not working with NSA?
But killing people, that's okay, or what?"

Sigur: "Now you're getting scared, aren't you?
You can control everything, but only if it doesn't come to light.
Whistleblowing is the real enemy!
What you need is a dark balance:
Everyone plays his part, everything remains secret, then the worst things can happen and nobody is really responsible.
Are you responsible for the combat robot deaths that die based on your position data? Or because of the friend lists you calculate and pass on to the NSA? No.

But if we uncover anything, we're supposed to be responsible.
It's the messenger's fault.
Uncover, whistleblowing has to be done responsibly, not everything else.
Who takes responsibility for the fact that we are only able to make people lose their lives when things become public? Who takes responsibility for the things that happen in secret? Nobody."

Lasse: "Sigur, we all have responsibility for everything.
Whether we're to blame for this mess or not.
We have only one earth, only one air, only one humanity.
You can't share responsibility."

It got quiet in the car.
One, two, three long minutes.
Then Fortunato smiled encouragingly at Lasse and Sigur: "Come.
We'll go to my place first.
It's just around the corner.
Then we'll eat something good and keep looking."
He started the car and drove back onto the road.
