## **1915**** After the bomb

### Brandenburg Gate, after a bomb explosion
____
Thick smoke over the square, bleeding human bodies lying around, boulders, wooden parts.
People are wandering across the square.
Some bleeding, distraught, deaf.

Hilde walks excitedly towards the place where Wilhelm talked to the people half an hour ago.
The lectern's gone.
In the hustle and bustle around the spot, she sees Adolf kneeling and bending over an unconscious woman, desperately trying to squeeze a piece of cloth off a wound in her belly.

Hilde: "Adolf!" She runs to him, looks at the woman, then at him again: "Adolf! Hej!" Adolf looks at her hectically: "We need paramedics."

Hilde: "Come on, let me do it.
I need your knife, and that shear over there."
She's pointing to the stage.
Adolf jumps up and returns a few moments later with the string.
Hilde has cut the woman's clothes open in the meantime and is now cleaning the wound with her own cloth.
She's bleeding badly.
With the rope, she ties the woman's arm, which is also injured.
Then she presses the cloth onto her stomach.
"There's something else in there.
She has to go to the hospital.
Go get a medic." Adolf disappears in the crowd.
Marlene tests the woman's breath with her ear on her mouth.
She's scared.
With one arm she pulls a man who is working his way past her towards her, presses the cloth into his hand and instructs him to press it onto the wound.
Then she starts to push with both hands firmly against the chest.
Three, four times, then she hears on her chest again.
Three more times, four more times.
Listen.
Over and over again.
Time passes.
Where was Adolf? After endless minutes, he comes.
A paramedic in tow.
He kneels right next to the woman.
Feel your pulse and check your breath.

Paramedic: "How long?"

Hilde: "5 to 6 minutes."

The paramedic gets up, "She's dead." He turns around and disappears into the crowd.

Hilde looks at Adolf and says, "Do you know where he is?" Adolf looks distraught at the woman, then at Hilde, then again at the woman.

Hilde: "Adolf! Wilhelm.
Do you know where Wilhelm is?"

Adolf confuses: "I don't know.
Where? Where? Wilhelm?
The woman's dead.
Wilhelm?
He went over there."
He points his arm across the square.

Hilde takes Adolf in her arms and pushes him.
After a while, she sets off and goes in the direction he pointed.
Adolf sits next to the dead woman, bends forward and puts his face in his hands.

"Sure!" calls Hilde after the first steps and slightly changed her direction.
She hurries across the square to a Renaissance building, in front of which there is a public telephone booth.
There she finds Wilhelm, telephone receiver in his hand, his coat hanging over his shoulder, gesticulating wildly.

"Thank God!" Hilde breathes a sigh of relief.
She goes to him and lays her hand on his back.
He looks briefly over her shoulder, smiles at her, and turns back to the phone.

Wilhelm yells: "We need more ambulances! Professor! There are probably 50 people left unattended to here, in my field of vision alone.
...  Brandenburg Gate ... West side ... Send what you have.?

He slams the receiver on the fork and turns to Hilde.
They're hugging.
But Hilde suddenly unlocks and grabs his arm.

Hilde: "You're hurt!" She touches his bloody bandage on his right upper arm.
A little blood had flowed from it towards the elbow.

Wilhelm: "Yes.
Knife thrust."

Hilde: "What?" She looks at him in disbelief.

Wilhelm: "Yes, the cowards came shortly after the bomb and wanted to get me.
But, PA, there were three Spartacists around the stage.
And that was enough.
For seven attackers.
One is dead."

Hilde embraced Wilhelm firmly.
"You have to be careful.
They want you.
You'll need a Spartacist Association just for yourself from now on.
And here you stand alone now...
You can't do that anymore! You can't do that anymore! Let's go somewhere safe."

Wilhelm: "No, it's not dangerous anymore.
You don't do anything spontaneously.
They plan such things, they carry out orders, they obey their superiors.
And the superiors aren't here.
Nothing of what's happening right now is planned.
And they can't handle it.
But when it comes to speeches, marches, meetings, negotiations, from now on, we have to be careful.
You, too! Your work in the orphanages, the soup kitchens, the worker schools, creates awareness among the people.
People like you.
They're after those who think for themselves, who don't want to subordinate themselves.
"Behind those who love the truth."

Hilde: "Come, Wilhelm. I don't want to stay here right now. We're going home. There's a meeting tonight so you can talk about what you want to do with it."
