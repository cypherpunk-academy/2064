## **2023** The Manifesto (2)

<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Marwin turned the page on </span> and continued: "6 -- We don't listen to each other.
We hear the words that someone else says and make our own thoughts out of them.
Then we won't have what the other guy was thinking.
Not what he said anymore.
Not even what we heard.
Then we have what we think about what we have heard from what the other has said, about what he has thought.
It's always these four levels when we communicate.
Thinking - Saying - Listening - Thinking.
And mostly all four differ, sometimes in grotesque ways, sometimes in decisive details.
Wars are waged, murders committed, people excluded - only because we do not distinguish between them.
These four things must grow together, become one.
But that's impossible.
You can't become one.
Nevertheless, we must try!
It's a matter of trying.
We must learn to look at things from more than one side, remain agile in our words and thoughts."

He turned the page.

"7 -- We need transparency, openness from everything public, from everything that concerns us, from everything that is not private.
When I use or consume something, I have a human right to know what happened to it before:
Who produced my electricity, which I take out of the socket, how was it built?
Who helped build my computer, who wrote my software, and what did he or she do?
What do companies do to develop a product, to build it, to sell it?
How does the state ensure my safety?
What's he doing for it?
Does he kill other people for it?
How many? Who's that?
Does he torture for it?
Is he suppressing?"

He turned the page.

"8 - We need courage, much courage, to overcome fear.
Fear is one of the two main instruments of oppression.
The more anxious people are, the easier it is to manipulate and control them.
Intimidation makes slaves.
Courage is the strength to overcome fear.
Courage is as contagious as fear.

And anger, it is the warm, mighty power in our body.
Anger is not aggression.
We need a lot of anger to overcome crippling hope.
Hope made from the outside paralyzes you.
We don't need this.
We always have enough hope for our own in us.
We just lose sight of them sometimes.
Hope dies last."

He turned the page.

"9-- people can't be numbers anymore.
A person cannot be statistically recorded.
It kills him.
The sentence "Eleven people died in a firefight" kills people a second time.
In reality, it was Anke, Helmut, Tim, Trevor, Silke, Antje, Lisa, Jochen, Leon, Aischa, and Finn.
They all died in different ways, they all had individual lives.
They were just together when they died.
People can't be numbers anymore, people are people."

He put the pencil on the table and looked at the text.

"Okay, "People are people.
That's a nice last word.
I think that's all," he thought.
"There's nothing more to it."

He took the pencil and wrote a summary:

"Encrypt,

real ideals,

to overcome the opposition,

free development,

I can empathize with you,

Thoughts instead of words,

Openness,

Courage and anger,

man as man".

He put the pencil back on the table and stretched out.

Marwin: "And who am I going to give this to?
...shit ...Linda? ...no! ...

Marlene!
Oskar!
Julian!
... But how?" He closed his eyes.
Then he raised his hands, opened his eyes, and shouted, "I need magic!"
He looked at the booklet intensively, rolled his eyes, spread his fingers over it in strange shapes and said mysteriously as he moved his hands up and down: "Abara Kadabra, find your way to ... Marlene ... Oskar ... Julian ... Tobi".

He looked astonished at his fingers and said to them, "Hmm?
What do you want?
What do you want now?"
He nodded.
"Yes, I can imagine.
I'd die for a keyboard.
And if it were just a trouser keyboard on a Raspberry Pi or Olimex board.
I miss it so much!
Shit! Shit! Shit!
That would be better than a mate on a Berlin roof at sunset." He took the pen and wrote:

"Love of technology."

He looked at the list and nodded.
"Now it's beautiful.
That's correct, we must develop a deep love of technology..."

He formed his fingers again in the most absurd way and moved them over the full-written sheet: "Abrakadubrabra," he said loudly, "fly to Marlene, fly to Oskar, fly to Julian and Tobi.
