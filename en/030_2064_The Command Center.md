## **2064** The Command Center

<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Marlene ran down the rock with Lilly</span>. At the dark green hyper-door, which stood at the foot of the rock, they passed by. Lasse and Sigur disappeared behind them with a slight blue twitch of light.

Marlene: "What's up? Why did you come for me?"

Lilly: "One of the ravens came flying in and said that there was a problem at the KCT and you were needed. That is as sweet as the ravens land in front of you, bow down and then wait until you have full consciousness with them."

Marlene: "A raven lands before you?"
She shook her head.
Then I guess you're part of the game management now.
They've accepted you.
"Pretty fast."

Lilly: "What's the KCT?"

Marlene: "The Command Center Taurus.
But that's not for you yet."

Lilly got shiny eyes and looked at Marlene.

Marlene: "No! No. No ...
You're 12.
You can't do that.
This is serious.
It's not part of the game anymore.
It's part of the defense.
The real defense."

Lilly didn't take her eyes from Marlene.
Lilly: "I know. Taurus, the conspiracy, Saruman."

Marlene looked at her in amazement: "How do you know?"

Lilly: "You write about it in your biography."

Marlene: "That is not a word about a conspiracy and not a word about Saruman and not a word about Taurus.
That's just a description of what could happen if there were hackers trying to invade."

Lilly looked at Marlene from the corner of her eye: "Come. It was obvious that it wasn't just theory.
That was way too concrete.
I understood that the first time I read it.
And I found the rest in the archive of your biography."

Marlene: "You hacked my archive? Fuck."

Lilly looked down briefly: "Did I do something bad?
That wasn't soooo well protected.
If you really wanted no one to get this, then..."

Marlene: "...it was a private archive, not a vulnerability database..."

Lilly: "Information that is for everyone."

Marlene: "For all adults!"

They looked each other in the eye.

Marlene looked down briefly and then nodded: "Good.
Okay. Okay.
You came in on your own, you didn't see any personal information.
It's okay.
Did any of that mess with your head?
Do you have any questions about what you saw there?"

Lilly got her glowing eyes again: "Thousands."
She smiled carefully.

Marlene: "Lilly! I'm serious about this.
There are things that can be disturbing.
Some people have nightmares about it."

Lilly: "I want to know.
I'm serious.
I know the Academy is under constant attack."

Marlene stroked her hand over her mouth and closed her eyes.
She stood with her eyes closed for a while, opened her again and looked at Lilly seriously:
"Well, then come on to the KCT."

Lilly lifted her arms: "Yep!"

Marlene touched the amulet hanging around her neck, muttered something and then clearly said, "Promote Lilly Browdowin to apprentice defence admin."

A red hyper-door appeared to Lilly's right.
She got scared easily.

Lilly: "Wow! So, quick. No fairy for feedback?"

Marlene: "Old Linux rule: No news is good news. If it works, there's no message.
Welcome to the defense of the Academy!"

Lilly breathed deeply: "Wow!"

Marlene pointed to the door and Lilly walked through.
Marlene followed her.
