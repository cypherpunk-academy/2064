## **1915** In a soup kitchen

### Berlin Moabit
____
Hilde in a soup kitchen behind a huge pot, a ladle in her hand.
People line up with plates and spoons.
At the entrance a group of Spartacists with assault rifles.

An older beggar enters the room, takes a plate, and looks at the end of the queue for a while.
Then he holds the plate in front of him and walks straight towards Hilde, but nobody in the queue gives him room.
He and Hilde look at each other.
She makes a sign to the woman who's next and waves the beggar over.
The man behind the woman grumbles loudly into his beard.
Hilde looks briefly with a matter-of-fact look and then fills the beggar's plate.

Hilde: "Enjoy your meal, brother."

He smiles at her with a deep warmth and then trots towards a dark corner.
Hilde fills the woman's plate.

Hilde: "This is Albert.
He grew up an orphan and found out who his parents were the day before yesterday.
You haven't lived far from him in 50 years.
He just came from the cemetery."

The woman nods and looks after the beggar.

Hilde: "Besides, he gets terrible rage outbursts if he has too little in his stomach.
That's why I let him in.
There's nothing he can do.
That's innate." She smiles at the woman and then turns to the man behind her.

Wilhelm sits in a corner of the room at a table with three others and talks with wild gestures.
The three of them listen to him spellbound and occasionally pull expressions as a reaction to what Wilhelm says.
At the next table, a woman sleeps with her head on the table, three children next to her playing a finger game.
Around them, there are a lot of bags filled with all kinds of things.
Opposite her, a man reads a leaflet to others, which is commented again and again vividly.
One table further on sitting two dark figures, one spooning a soup, the other in front of him a glass of beer.

The beggar sits on the floor leaning against a wall and spoons his soup very concentrated with a slightly trembling hand.
When the plate is empty, he carefully places it on his lap and turns his gaze to Hilde.
He looks at her for a long time with a gentle gaze.

Suddenly a loud discussion burns up at the entrance.
It gets quiet in the room.
The Spartacist group leader gets in the way of a police captain.
Both quickly have a group of uniformed and armed men behind them.
The captain holds a sheet of paper in the group leader's face and loudly demands access.
He reluctantly takes the paper and reads it slowly.
Then he takes a step to the side.
The captain grabs the paper and enters the room.
Behind him, about six or seven policemen.
He approaches Hilde directly, while the others spread out in the room and start looking for something on the tables, in bags and under the benches.

Captain strict: "Madam! The concession to hand out food, please."

Hilde looks at him: "I know.
We need a concession here.
We set this up on the spur of the moment.
Look at the people.
They were sometimes two or three days without food until the day before yesterday."

The captain looks briefly through the room.

Captain: "They need a concession.
That's the rules."

Hilde: "I know.
We'll have to pay a fine if we don't have one, won't we?
30 Reichsmarks, I think.
I understand that the law is the law.
And there's been some infection from bad kitchens.
Our group here has a lot of experience.
We've made hundreds of lunch soups already.
You are welcome to take a look in the kitchen.
I'm gonna go and tell those people there to stop cooking.
They're preparing the second pot right now.
More people are coming today than usual."

The captain looks at Hilde and scratches his head.

Captain: "Finish this off normally today.
Clean it up good.
Then that's fine."

Hilde: "We'll do it, fine."

Captain: "And go to Motzstraße 17 tomorrow.
There's a city commissioner, Geimer, on the second floor.
He issues concessions.
Say hello to him from Captain Schlöndorf."

The captain nodded to Hilde briefly and turned into the room to make himself a picture of the situation.
Four policemen have surrounded the beggar by now.
He seems to be asleep.
One kicks him with his foot.

First policeman: "Hello! Get up! We told you not to come around here anymore."

The beggar's not responding.
Wilhelm jumps up and approaches the policeman in a threatening attitude.
"Wilhelm!" calls Hilde and gives him a sign that he should go back.
Another policeman taps the beggar with his foot.
He presses his pocket, which he has taken in front of his chest, closer to himself, but does not open his eyes.

Second policeman: "HEY!"

The beggar blinks and says calmly and with slow pronunciation: "I just want to rest a little here."

First policeman: "Well, you're coming with us now."
He's reaching under his arms.
The second one will help.
The beggar makes himself heavy and blinks again.

Beggar: "I want to rest a little here."

They pick him up with effort so that he stands more or less strait.
He's staggering.
When they let him loose a little, he bends away again and sinks back to the wall.
He looks at both of them calmly.

Beggar: "Just get some sleep, and then I'll go to the cemetery."

The first policeman bends over him again.
The beggar looks at him with big eyes, blinking almost childlike.

Policeman: "Come on.
We'll carry him out."

Four policemen are starting to lift him up.
The beggar precedes them by getting up himself.
He looks around.

Beggar: "I ate here.
I'm full now.
It's warm in here.
I just want to get some rest."

He's sinking back against the wall.
The four policemen stand helpless around him for a moment.
The captain approaches from behind looks at the beggar, and then says: "Come, leave him alone.
We're leaving!"

They're leaving the hall.
Hilde starts to make soup again and smilingly says to the man who just had his turn:
"He knows exactly how to do it. You can learn a lot from him."
