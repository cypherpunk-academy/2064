## **2064**** Attack!

<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lasse and Sigur</span> stood in their game room in front of their floating screens.
Everyone held two fist-sized game controllers in his hands, which he moved, pressed and turned in a complicated way.
Both were extremely concentrated and tense.
In a room about two times two times two meters in size in front of the screens an air fight was to be seen, different flying combat robots, which hunted each other and tried to avoid each other.
At the bottom right was a date: 22.
March 2028.

Sigur: "FROM LEFT!"

Lasse: "HINTER DIR!"

Sigur: "Get him off me! GET YOUR WAY..."

Lasse: "Little moment."

Lasse jumped a little to the left, tore up his right arm, shook the controller twice in his left hand and then began to press both controllers wildly.
Shortly thereafter one heard loud explosion noises.

Lasse laughed out loud as he flew through the huge cloud of fire in front of him: "BOOM! He's gone!"

Sigur took a breath: "Thank you.
One more.
We'll do it together.
Come on, we'll fly a wing spiral.
Three, two, one, go..."

The two combat robots of Lasse and Sigur flew up in a loop, distanced themselves from each other, then turned around their own axis and fell together on the enemy combat robot, offset by 90 degrees.
He tried to escape with all sorts of flight manoeuvres.
But Lasse and Sigur were too well-rehearsed a team to leave him a gap.
Sigur sat right behind him.
He missed a few opportunities to shoot, stayed behind until he was so close that his opponent gave up and just flew straight on.
Sigur pressed the buttons on his two controllers once briefly, two Scram rockets fired off and the combat robot in front of him also disappeared in a fireball.

Lasse, Sigur: "YEAH!!" They threw their controllers on the table and slapped each other.

Lasse: "That was awesome! Wow. Wow.
I've never had an air fight like this before.
That was really serious.
I almost started sweating."

Sigur: "They were really good.
They didn't feel like computer players at all.
Well programmed.
Cool.

Lasse: "Maybe they weren't computer players."

Sigur: "Come ... hey ... you think we just brought five real players from heaven? That would be awesome.
No.
Why would they just dare to attack us like that? You must know who we are."

Lasse raised his forehead, "Maybe because there were five of them?"

Sigur smiled: "Okay, let's fly these things home.
It's only 10 minutes today anyway."

In front of her screens, Lilly appeared as a three-dimensional figure about 50 cm tall.
They both stopped breathing.
They looked spellbound at her.

Lilly: "I have a message for you from Marlene.
You must come at once."

Lilly's picture disappeared.
Lasse and Sigur looked at each other stunned.

Lasse: "Why now? What's the matter with you? I don't get it. I don't get it.
All we did was get some flying robots out of the sky." He felt his heartbeat grow stronger.
"What were their signatures like?"

Sigur: "All wrong.
I checked.
Camouflage."

Lasse: "Camouflage, or..."

Sigur: "Let's go.
We don't have much time."

Lasse and Sigur placed themselves in front of their monitors on two equilibrium sensors, square plates about 60 cm in size, with which one could very well walk, sit, jump, turn, run, lie and crouch simulate.
The room darkened.
They took two glass balls about 50 cm in diameter.
They were very light, open at the bottom and had a shoulder pad.
They put them on and both bullets shone in white light.
