## **2064** The Cypherpunk Academy

<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The plane had landed</span> at a regional airport.
Sigur and Tim got out.
Next to the tarmac, the enormous white balloon hovered about 20 meters above the ground.
He covered the whole scene in shadows.
Its outer skin seemed to be made of a harder material than ordinary balloons, maybe hard plastic or even metal.
He looked heavy and didn't seem to be able to fly.
He didn't have an actual basket on the bottom either, just a kind of weight.
Sigur was amazed again at his sheer size.
He discovered a shaft beside the weight, which seemed to lead into the balloon and from which two blue ropes hung down to the ground.
Below, Lasse waited with a broad grin.

Sigur ran off and fell into Lasse's arms.

Lasse: "Hej!
So good to see you!
You cyberterrorist!"

Sigur: "Sure!" They laughed and slapped each other.
Tim came along, and Lasse hugged him.

Sigur: "That was an action!
Unbelievable!
I've never sweated so much and so many times on any mission.
I didn't expect us to meet again in the game.
And the ride over here, with Tim, the full madness..."

Lasse exhaled.
"And then, we'll meet here." He pointed to the balloon.
"You see the balloon, don't you?"

Sigur: "Yeah, sure.
It's big enough.
How am I supposed to miss him?
What's that, anyway?
Tim didn't see him before..."

Lasse turned to Tim and pointed to the balloon: "Tim, do you see the balloon?"

Tim: "Which balloon again?
There's an airport, a tarmac, a few meadows behind it.
Are you starting now?
What's the point?"

Sigur surprised.
"But don't you see we're in the shadows?
Where did he come from?"

Tim: "Hej, stop it now!
There's no shadow here.
I'm blinded by the sun." And he actually closed his eyes a little.

Sigur looked astonished at Lasse: "What is this?
Is he blind?"

Lasse shook his head: "No, not at all.
The balloon is the Cypherpunk Academy.
You can't see them unless you're Cypherpunk."

Sigur: "_This is the Cypherpunk Academy?
Sweet!
But I'm not..."

Lasse: "Yes!
You are.
You can call it anything you want." He proudly hit him on the shoulder: "Congratulations.
Come on, grab a rope.
We must get to the Sphinx."

Sigur shook his head and took one of the ropes: "And if I don't want to be a Cypherpunk..."

Lasse: "Yes, you do.
Trust me on this.
Put your foot down in the loop like this.
And then touch here."

Sigur: "First say goodbye to Tim."

Lasse: "You don't have to!
That's what TRON does.
Everything we do with the ropes Tim doesn't see anymore.
TRON makes us say goodbye in a normal way or something else.
It probably already happened.
You can watch it later."

Sigur looked at him in astonishment.
Lasse winked at him, stuck his foot in the rope, and rushed up.
After a few seconds, he disappeared into the shaft of the balloon.
Sigur looked at Tim again, but he had already turned away and went back to the plane.
He was talking to somebody invisible.

Sigur carefully put his foot into the loop, looked up and held on.
Then the rope made a jerk by itself, and he rushed up.
His hands were stuck, his legs pushed through by some unknown force.
He was getting faster and faster.
It was pitch dark in the shaft.
He hurried further up.
After some time he saw individual dots of color appear on the shaft wall around him, then they began to move, becoming more and bigger and finally, everything turned into a sea of colorful leaves, small fish and other things that floated and flowed in confusion.
He shot out of the tube.
The rope disappeared from his hand, and he landed on a platform in the middle of a huge dome.
The platform had a diameter of about five meters and fell down vertically on all sides.
He didn't see the floor.
To the right of him stood Lasse on a similar plateau.
Sigur lifted his thumb towards him, but Lasse looked back only briefly and did not answer.
Lasse looked concentrated at a spot far in front of him on the dome wall as if something would come out there at any moment.
He went to his knees slightly and spread his arms out.

"Welcome to the Academy, Sigur," said a voice next to Sigur and he turned to her.
Mostafa, the mosquito fly, fluttered in front of his face and looked at him friendly.
"I am Mostafa!
We met at the introductory event."

Sigur nodded.

Mostafa: "Lasse is already waiting for the Sphinx.
It's always dangerous.
With the Sphinx, you never know what's gonna happen.
You really have to be careful about that."

They looked at Lasse for a while.

Mostafa: "You're the one who did the first LBI mission with Lasse, aren't you?"

Sigur: "Exactly! And you can be asked anything about the Cypherpunk Academy, right?"

Mostafa: "Not only that. I am also the teacher for reading and writing.
Of course, reading and writing code, programs.
Cypherpunks write programs.
It's like the once-in-a-lifetime here.
That's why we have the Cypherpunk computer playground."

Sigur: "I can program."

Mostafa: "I know.
That's why you're not going to the playground.
But there are some things you don't know.
That'll come later for you."

Sigur looked over to Lasse again, who made strange evasive movements: "Do I have to go to the Sphinx too?"

Mostafa: "You don't have to." He grinned.
"You have to.
The Sphinx guards all exits and entrances to the Academy.
You must pass her again and again. Otherwise, you won't even get into the academy."

Sigur: "How?
This isn't in there yet?"

He pointed to the enormous dome hall, which in his eyes had to be about as big as the whole balloon.
He looked to the right and was startled.
Lasse had suddenly disappeared, and where his platform was before, there was now a massive boulder with an oversized beehive in the middle.
Wim, the bear, sat on top of it and looked over at them with calm eyes.

Sigur was amazed: "What...?
Where's...?"

"Come with me," Mostafa said and flew off.
"Wim is waiting for you."

"How am I supposed to get over there?
I can't fly, and it's too far to jump," Sigur called after him and looked down the edge of the platform.

Mostafa shouted from the other side: "In the Cypherpunk Academy, everything goes with thoughts.
Think your way there!"

Sigur nodded to Mostafa: "I understand."
He took a step back, put his hands to the side of his forehead, and said quietly, "To the bear, to the bear." Nothing moved.

Mostafa: "You have to let go.
Just think.
Trust!

Sigur tried it a few more times, and again, nothing happened.

Mostafa flew over to him again: "Well?
Misfire?
You don't have to think you want to go, you have to think you're there."

Sigur's ears plopped, a sting went through his eyes, he pinched them, and when he opened his eyes again, he stood right in front of the bear's rock.
He got dizzy.
He stumbled to the right and could barely catch himself.
Mostafa flew under his arm and supported him.

Mostafa: "No problem, no problem.
It's always at the first teleport.
You're about to get sick.
Your brain's pretty slow registering that you're somewhere else now without going there.
It doesn't know that yet."

Sigur grabbed his stomach.
He kneeled down.

Wim jumped down from the beehive and sat down cross-legged in front of Sigur on the floor.
After a while, he straightened up and sat down.
A pleasant atmosphere emanated from Wim.
He looked at Sigur with alert, interested eyes and an invisible smile.
Sigur's body relaxed.
He felt lighter.
The efforts of the last days fell away from him.

"Welcome to the Academy, Sigur," the bear hummed in a deep voice. "This stone marks the entrance to the Plain Islands.
You'll see why they're called that.
There are eleven of them."

Sigur: "Eleven? As many as basic ideas?"

Wim: "Exactly.
And above the eleventh level floats my garden.
That's the target.
It's gonna be a while before you get there.
The task is to find the way there, or actually, to build it.

It is a kind of path of thought, connections from one idea to the next, with many branches.
Branches are contradictions and their resolution.
You can see everything in the world from different directions, for example, a tree.
It looks very different from one side than from the other.
That contradicts itself.
But it's still the same tree.
It's the same with thoughts.
People often argue just because they look at one and the same thought from two different directions.
If you find a thought in a city on an island, you will first resolve its contradictions, then find new contradictions, and finally add your own thoughts, to which other Cypherpunks will then find contradictions and resolutions.
It's a kind of cycle.
The best contradictions, resolutions, and thoughts remain.
The others disappear again after a while.
In this way, the Cypherpunks who seek the way are continually changing the Plain Islands.
And to this world, here is the entrance."

Sigur nodded. He looked around.

Sigur: "Where?"

Wim: "Are you ready?"

Sigur: "To go inside?
Yes!

Wim: "Are you ready for what will come?"

Sigur: "What's coming?"

Wim: "What will come, will come.
Look around you!
"Notice that there is nothing dangerous around you, nothing that threatens your life."

Sigur looked around, shook his head.

Wim: "If anything feels insecure, focus on it."

Sigur: "Nothing."

Wim: "Ask yourself: You got everything you need?
Is there something you're waiting for that's necessary before you can move on?
Anything you need to know? Or clarify?
Or can you just be here the way you are?"

Sigur closed his eyes and breathed calmly.
He nodded.

Wim: "Go with your consciousness to a place behind your eyes."

Wim: "Stay there for a moment."

Wim: "No, stay there.
Don't go away."

Wim: "Now go a little deeper."

Wim: "There's nothing dangerous around you."

Wim: "Slowly go down further and see where you feel resistance.
Neck... chest... stomach... legs.
Then back to the chest and through the arms.
Back to the head at the starting point." He waited a few moments.
"Now go where you felt the most resistance."

Wim: "Stay there for a minute."

One minute later, Wim said, "Okay."

Sigur looked at Wim.
"What's the point?"

Wim: "Don't leave.
Stay in that feeling.
That's preparation for what's coming now."

Sigur: "What's next?"

But Wim had already disappeared, as had the beehive, and Sigur's platform.
The whole dome changed at breathtaking speed.
Sigur got up instinctively and took a step back.
He looked to all sides.
It now stood on a rocky plain that reached all the way to the dome.
Everything got darker, got sharper edges and outlines and suddenly you could hear a deep rumbling in the whole dome.
The whole room trembled, then suddenly a huge, circular area of the dome stood in flames.
Sigur stared there.
Some of the flames hit far into the dome.
All of a sudden a dark figure with a bird's head and enormous wings shot out of the middle of the circle at high speed and flew up to the dome roof, then from there directly towards Sigur.
She let about a dozen egg-shaped, burning formations fly in the direction of Sigur.
He threw himself on the ground, turned to the side, and could barely avoid being hit.
The Sphinx landed on the ground about twenty meters in front of him and became bigger and bigger and bigger until it occupied about a third of the height of the dome.

Sigur said quietly, "The Sphinx!"

She bent down to him and asked with a loud, rumbling voice:

"WHO ARE YOU TO DARE COME BEFORE ME?"

Sigur stood up and answered without hesitation: "A man!" He knew he had to respond quickly.

The Sphinx let her wings flutter up and screamed in pain.
Then she gathered her strength and put on her wings.
She had shrunk a little and looked at Sigur darker and more severely.

Sphinx: "What do you want to do behind this porch?"

Sigur: "Learning.
I want to learn."

For the second time, the Sphinx cried out in a mark-shattering manner.
Sigur looked at her with high concentration.
Whenever he answered "right," she would lose strength and get angrier.
"Right" meant, from her point of view, right.
That was important, that's what Lasse had told him.
The sphinx thought it possessed all the wisdom of the world, the full truth.
To defeat the Sphinx, you had to understand how she thought.

The Sphinx calmed down again, bent over to Sigur and threateningly turned her head back and forth:

Sphinx: "WHAT DO YOU NEED HERE MOST?"

Sigur: "Love of justice."

"That was easy," Sigur thought, "The enemies of the Internet in 2028 were out to divide the world into people who lived in prosperity and those who were supposed to work for it.
Those who oppressed and those who were oppressed, those who lived in safety, and those who were always in danger."

The cry of the sphinx became more and more a howl.
Her eyes became darker, she began to lose strength, her wings became stiffer, she continued to shrink.

Sphinx: "What's stronger than all the secret services and poor and business in this world?"

Sigur took a moment to cut it short.
It had once known.
It had slipped his mind.
But it had been so easy.
What the hell was that?
He was concentrating.
The sphinx began to cluster.

Sigur: "Youth!" He breathed out.
That was a close one.
You had to answer within three seconds. Otherwise, it was too late.

The Sphinx howled loudly and cursed thunderously: "Son of a bitch!
Good-for-nothing!
Stupid!" She roared with her wings.

Sphinx: "What do you do when you fail?"

Sigur: "I cannot fail. When I make mistakes, I learn, when I make no mistakes, I rejoice."

The Sphinx sighed, loud and miserable.
Her voice became fragile.
She trembled slightly.

Sphinx: "YOU WILL LOSE YOURSELF HERE!"

Sigur nodded clearly.

"And that's exactly what I want," he said with a big grin.

A deep, warm voice sounded from the background:

"Say it differently again."

Sigur more seriously, "I want to lose myself to find myself."

A miserable cawing came from the beak of the Sphinx.
She cowered on the floor and turned in pain.
Then she straightened up with her last strength.

Sphinx: "You can't win against me."

That was a trick question.
The word "against" was the decisive one.
Sigur said triumphantly, "But I can win. Again and again!"

He jumped off his platform, ran towards the Sphinx, which had solidified to stone, and gave her a kick.
Everything crumbled to dust and was gradually carried out by an emerging wind.

The whole hall changed again.
Around him appeared enormously thick, matte shining oaks with hanging lianas, many other trees, moss-covered stones that seemed to look at him, and directly in front of him a small, reflecting pond with dense bushes around it and a light mist above it that appeared to have its own life.
Everything around Sigur turned into a mysterious forest.
Various, strange animals crawled, flew or crawled around.
He discovered a beautiful, large, poisonous-looking lotus flower not far from him in a clearing.
None of this was messy.
Everything seemed to have a strange order, every movement revealed its meaning.
Sigur looked around, marveled, was a little afraid.
From behind, a bright, soft voice said, "Sigur!" He turned around and in front of him sat Tin, the owl, on a tree stump.

Sigur bowed.

Tin: "I also welcome you, warmly.
Lasse is waiting for you at the Cypherpunk Café."

Sigur: "Is this the magic forest?
Why did I end up here now?
I was just standing in front of the entrance to the Plain Islands."

Tin: "The magical forest is the place where all past thoughts and decisions are kept.
You can solve puzzles and find answers to questions here.
For the Plain Islands, you need the magic forest because of the food that grows in it.
Such as this."

Tin pointed to a tree on which there were funny shaped blue and pink fruits.

"You can't pick them, you have to solve the riddle of the tree, then you'll get fruit from it again and again, which you'll need on the Plain Islands.
But the most important thing here in the magic forest are errors of thought, especially the errors of thought that all or most of the people of a time or region have in them.
You look like that."

Tin pointed to the clearing with the lotus flower.

"When you touch her, what she appears above the flower."

Tin sent a dragonfly to the lotus flower.
Above her appeared writing of pollen that shone strangely.

<div style="background-color: #222; color: lightgreen; padding: 20px; margin: 20px 0; font-family: 'Courier New'">
You have to adapt to achieve something in life to be successful. And everything you don't do because you adapt, you have to replace it. For example, by having a lot of money, making the most beautiful house, the most exciting trips, or anything else exciting or beautiful.
</div>
"On the Plains Islands, you'll find someone who fits this thought error.
It is suitable for almost all people of this time, but with this one, it is particularly evident.
He or she is looking for the thought, and you can then give him or her the thought, then you will get something for it."

The dragonfly flew through the writing, and it disappeared.
At the same time, Sigur instinctively opened his hand, and a small, square, colorfully painted leaf appeared on it.
He looked at it and wondered where he could keep it.

Tin: "Just think: This is mine. Then it disappears into your invisible backpack."

The leaf disappeared from Sigur's hand.

Tin "There are many of them here.
To get into the garden of Wim, you have to find them all and give them away.
But there are not just wrong thoughts here.
There are also many things you can discover, just like that.
You see that musty heap back there?"

Sigur nodded.

Tin: "With white mold underneath and poisonous, stinking mud in which nothing can grow."

Sigur looked at the pile.

Tin: "This is a relationship between two people who argued a lot and forced each other into things they didn't want to do.
They were very emotionally involved in each other, wanted to change each other.
And they never cleaned it up."

Sigur shuddered at the sight. His gaze turned to a scrawny undergrowth lying next to it.

Tin: "The thorn bush here?
Those were word battles, discussions.
Everything dies when you look at it in foreign words.
That's why you'll be making your own words for things here at the academy.
It doesn't help if you repeat what someone else said.
You will learn to see everything from different angles and come to thoughts that are alive instead of just having words.
There's not the truth, there's only truth.
The most contradictory things can be true."

Sigur: "Lasse thought this was the wisdom."

Tin said, "Wisdom is the past.
Love is the future."

Sigur nodded.

Tin: "I see you want to go fast now ... But you are not ready yet.
...you'll also have to pass the plane sphinxes."

Sigur: "I know, Tin.
The plane sphinxes.
I'm ready."

Tin: "You're ready?"

Sigur: "I'm ready!" He stood up straight in front of her.

Tin looked at him with anxious eyes.

Tin: "On what level do you want?"

Sigur: "What level is Lasse on?"

Tin: "Level 4."

Sigur: "Then, to level 4!"

Tin nodded, "So be it.
Level 1: Free software, encryption, distributed services, and everything else that any power in the world can withstand."

Sigur nodded back: "I know the 11 basic ideas of the Cypherpunks."

Tin: "I know, I know.
Level 1 is given to you." She threw a brightly colored glass ball into the air, which floated away and after a while disintegrated into thousands of small specks of dust of all colors.
Sigur marveled at her, laughing.

She looked at Sigur: "Level 2: Life ideals: justice, openness, equality, brotherhood, and everything else that elevates us as human beings."

Sigur nodded, "Freedom, letting others share..."

Tin: "Level 2 ... is also given to you.
It's very rare to get two levels for free. You can, of course, visit and explore them at any time." She threw a different colored bullet into the air, which also destroyed.

Sigur smiled.
His eyes were beaming.

Tin: "Level 3: Overcoming opposition, and anything else that removes boundaries between people."

Sigur nodded.

Tin: "Level 3: The level Sphinx is waiting for you.
Are you ready?" She looked at him insistently.

Sigur: "Yes."

Tin fluttered her wings, and in a flash, the magic garden disappeared, and Sigur found himself in a dungeon without a window.
Everywhere roughly hewn, damp stones, held together by mortar, much moss, and a straw-covered stone floor.
It smelled hot of feces.
Sigur covered his nose.
He looked around in amazement.
He didn't know that.
Lasse hadn't told him that.
He thought, walked around, looked at the walls.
The only light came from a tiny lattice door with massive iron bars at one end of the room.
It was just so big he could crawl out through it if it was open.
He checked the massive hinges but found no weakness, even the lock was missing.
The grid was welded.
He grasped the sticks, shook them.
Impossible to move them even a millimeter.
He shouted loudly down the adjacent corridor.
No answer.
He tried to think his way back to the Cypherpunk Café, back to the bear, to the magic garden, but nothing happened.
Then he grabbed his head with both hands: "Oh no!
Not miraculous, not miraculous."

"Yes!" said a voice behind him.
Sigur turned around.
A little rat looked at him with big, shy eyes.

He held both hands in front of his face and thought, "Oh, no!
I'm barely ten minutes here and already at Miraculous.
Lasse has only been with him twice in all his time!"

Miraculous: "Yes, yes.
You fucked up, you Cypherpunk!"
