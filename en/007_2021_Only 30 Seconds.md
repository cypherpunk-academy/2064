Marlene bit into a thick hamburger and looked with slightly pinched eyes at her brother Marwin, who was sitting next to her. Her face was still turkey red. Out of the loudspeakers of the hamburger restaurant boomed overloud music. You almost had to scream if you wanted to talk across the table.

"Absolutely not. I won't delete anything," Marlene said with a half-full mouth at a normal volume, so that her brother could barely hear it. "It's all here on the stick. Nowhere else. I was careful. The stick was new. I cleaned up the computer at Princeton University. Nobody knows me. Nobody knows my source. The computer is also new. Tell me why it's dangerous."

Her brother looked at her urgently: "This is TAO, Tailored Access Operations. These are the best hackers in the NSA. No matter what the key and address were looking for on the computer, you have to delete everything you have from there, immediately. And don't touch anything anymore."

Marlene: "You've always said that NSA only has snorers, officers in a huge agency who argue and spy on each other, prefer lunch breaks and after work to hacking. They are people without dedication and conviction. That's why they have no chance against us. You said that to me. And now what?

Marwin: "TAO is special forces. They are real hackers, former real hackers. Some of them were blackmailed: Either you work for us, or you go to jail for 50 years, decide ... And if you bend over there ... Some of them are excellent hackers. They come in everywhere. And they have a huge database with lots of weak points, many of which are not even known on the Internet yet. They have something for every computer, for every network. Also for yours. If they take you for a ride, they'll get you. Maybe they're not always fully dedicated, but the tools they have are devastating."

Marlene: "Okay. I see. And because they can get me theoretically, I let it go. Oops, danger! Since when do YOU let someone intimidate you? I always thought you are the one that can't be intimidated, never ever. YOU have always told me that this is precisely what they want to achieve. They puff themselves up, want to appear invincible so that you retract your tail. Small. Intimidated. Again: I was in Tails all the time, I changed my identity several times, I only met my source in Tails, the computer was brand new: "Where is the risk?

Marwin moaned slightly. "Maybe not much has happened yet. But if you tried to log in to the computer you sent me the address from, they'd set hell in motion. Then they search everywhere, a whole team. They would set traps, do things that require enormous effort: for example, to analyze the traffic of the Tor network worldwide all at once. They need a few data centers at short notice. But that's what they do. And that's where they can find out who they are from individual people in the Tor network. You, too ... But maybe they'll just arrest a few hackers on the off chance that they're suspicious ..."

"I was in..." interrupted Marlene. "But only very briefly. I copied log files, keys, and passwords, nothing else. And I cleaned up."

Marwin became pale.

Marlene looked at Marwin who said nothing: "Marwin, it was only 30 seconds. It was a normal Linux computer, Debian 10. Exactly what the programmers from the Tor project use to develop Tor."

She looked at Marwin, cheering her up. He didn't react.

Marlene: "It's all here on the stick. Nowhere else."

She opened her hand a little bit, and Marwin looked at the stick. He reached for it, but Marlene pulled her hand away. He buried his head under his hands.

Marlene: "Come. You were out on BND computers umpteen times last year, surveillance camera database, remember? And the German secret service isn't so bad either. And I was there the whole time. I paid good attention there. You know what I can do. I was careful."

Marwin grabbed her belly. Marlene looked at him in amazement: "Is it really that serious?

Marwin nodded and then looked at her a little shyly: "I have to go to the c-base. So for two hours. After that, we have to talk again. Where are you then?

The c-base was one of the most famous hackerspaces in Berlin. The only one who actually made it into tourist guides. In the main hall, people sometimes walked around with their cameras hung around, and curiously looked at everything. In the basement, there was a members area. There one could be relatively well among oneself.

Marlene: "I will be here. I'll read a bit."

Marwin: "Okay. I'll pick you up here and then we'll go home."

Marwin got up and left the restaurant. Marlene pulled a paperback out of her laptop.
