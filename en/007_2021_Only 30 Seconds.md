## **2021** Only 30 seconds

<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Marlene bit </span> into a big hamburger and looked with slightly pinched eyes at her brother Marwin, who was sitting next to her.
Her face was still turkey red.
Out of the loudspeakers of the Hamburg restaurant boomed overloud music.
You almost had to scream if you wanted to talk over the table.

"Absolutely not.
I won't delete anything," Marlene said with a half-full mouth at normal volume so that her brother could barely hear it.
"It's all here on the stick.
Nowhere else.
I was paying attention.
The stick was new.
I cleaned up Princeton University's computer.
Nobody knows me.
Nobody knows my source.
The computer's new, too.
Explain to me why it's dangerous."

Her brother looked at her with a vivid smile: "This is TAO, Tailored Access Operations.
They're the best hackers in NSA.
No matter what the key and address were looking for on the computer, you have to delete everything you have from there immediately.
And don't touch anything anymore."

Marlene: "You've always said that NSA only has snorers, officers in a huge agency who argue and spy on each other, prefer lunch breaks and after work to hackers.
There are no people who work with dedication and conviction.
That's why they don't stand a chance against us. Now what?"

Marwin: "TAO is a special group.
These are real hackers, former real hackers. Some of them were blackmailed: Either you work for us or you go to jail for 50 years ... And if you bend over there ... There are really great people there.
They come in everywhere.
And they have a huge database with all the vulnerabilities known on the Internet.
There's something for every computer.
Yours too.
If they're gonna take you for a ride, they're gonna get you, too.
Perhaps they are not always wholehearted, but the tools they have are devastating."

Marlene: "Okay.
I see what you mean.
And because they can theoretically get me, I'm letting it go.
Oops, danger!
Since when does YOU let you intimidate me?
You always told me that was exactly what you wanted to achieve.
They puff themselves up, want to appear invincible so you can pull your dick in.
Small.
Intimidated.
Again: I was in Tails all the time, I only met my source in Tails, the computer was brand new: Where's the risk?"

Marwin moaned slightly.
"Maybe not much has happened yet. But if you tried to log into the computer from which you sent me the address, they'd set hell in motion.
Then they look everywhere, all over the team. They would set traps, do things that require enormous effort: for example, analyze the traffic of the Tor network worldwide all at once.
They need a few data centers at short notice.
But they do.
And there they can find out who they are from individual people on the goal net.
You too... Maybe they'll just arrest some hackers on the off chance that they're suspicious..."

"I was in..." interrupted Marlene.
"But only very briefly.
I copied log files, keys and passwords, nothing else.
And I cleaned up."

Marwin turned pale.

Marlene looked at Marwin, who said nothing: "Marwin, it was only 30 seconds.
It was a normal Linux computer, Debian 10.
Exactly what programmers from the Tor project use to develop Tor."

She looked at Marwin, cheering her up.
He didn't respond.

Marlene: "It's all here on the stick.
Nowhere else."

She opened her hand a crack and Marwin looked at the stick.
He reached for the stick, but Marlene pulled her hand away.
He buried his head under his hands.

Marlene: "Come.
You were on computers at the BND umpteen times last year.
And the German secret service isn't that bad either.
And I was there the whole time.
I took good care of that.
You know what I can do.
I was paying attention."

Marwin grabs his stomach.
Marlene looked at him in astonishment: "Is this so serious?"

Marwin nodded and then looked at her a little shyly: "I have to go to the c-base.
For about two hours.
After that, we need to talk again.
Then where are you?"

The c-base was one of the most famous hacker spaces in Berlin.
The only one who actually made it into tourist guides.
In the main hall people sometimes walked around with their cameras hung around and curiously looked at everything.
In the basement there was a member area.
It was a good place to be alone.

Marlene: "I'll be here.
I read a little."

Marwin: "Okay.
I'll pick you up here and then we'll go home."

Marwin got up and left the restaurant.
Marlene pulled a paperback from her laptop bag and began to read.
A play about Hilde von Papenburg, a freedom fighter during the First World War.
