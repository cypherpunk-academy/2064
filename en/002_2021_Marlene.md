<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Marlene gähnte.</span> German lessons, 10th grade, pressed boredom in the room.
Anni next to her chatted under the table with her smartphone.
She herself fished a tin of bread out of her school bag and placed it on the table in front of her.
She opened them, took out butter, cheese and cucumber slices wrapped in paper and lovingly arranged them next to each other.
Then she took a knife out, took a slice of bread and was about to start lubricating the butter on it when the teacher suddenly stood next to her.

Teacher: "Well? And why don't you do that at home?" He bounced his feet.

Marlene looked at him calmly.
A rage rose in her: "That's the most exciting and creative thing I can do right now."

Teacher pointed: "More exciting than Goethe's Faust? I can hardly imagine.
Either you..."

Marlene interrupted him: "I've been sitting here for over an hour and have to listen to what people have fart out about Faust and Mephisto ... in the last 200 years.
What am I supposed to do with it? I don't even know people.
What does that have to do with my life? Does that have anything to do with anything today?"

The teacher breathed deeply.
He looked at her.

Marlene: "You're not up for it yourself, are you?"

The teacher took a step back, pointed toward the door and shouted, "OUT!" He closed his eyes.
Marlene packed up her things, took her bag and walked out of the room past the teacher.

He shouted after her: "You wait outside, right in front of the door.
We'll talk after." The door slammed shut.

Marlene went straight home.
"Such a pussy," she thought, "probably that farts out had been too much for him." After all, he had written one of the books they had to read about Faust himself, so he could take it personally.
She actually liked him, he was so cool as a person, but in the teaching role ... He probably didn't like them himself.
"A real pussy," she thought, "can't live his life the way he wants." She shook her head.
"And what do I do now with the day that has begun? ...
Sure!" she said out loud and snapped her fingers.

Half an hour later she was sitting on the large staircase to the right of the entrance to the town hall of Neukölln in a shady corner.
It was a hot day, around 28 degrees, and she was now wearing a short, airy dress that she had put on on a jump home.
She felt a little uncomfortable in it, usually she wasn't wearing anything like that.
But now it served its purpose.

She pulled a still shrink-wrapped laptop out of her cloth bag.
It was unused, but not completely new.
It was from the year 2009 and had not yet installed the monitoring chips, which were now found in all new computers.
With them, secret services could remotely control any computer over the Internet, view, copy, delete files, even install a new operating system if they wanted, and some computers could even be turned on over the network.

Oskar, one of her friends, had discovered ten of the computers in the company where he worked, in a corner of the camp.
No one there seemed to know, they were not listed in the camp list, so he had simply taken them with him.
He had driven a forklift truck into the warehouse and had loaded a lot of old boxes together with the computers and had simply driven them out.
He had told the camp leader that he would need the boxes for a student project.
What a gift in times when the serial number of each computer was tracked from production to dump and stored along with the email addresses, phone numbers, whereabouts, and photos of each owner.

She inserted a memory stick with the inscription "Tails 4.8" into a slot on the computer and pressed the power button.
Tails was a program, or rather an operating system, that made sure that nobody could find out who was using the computer it was running on.
And even where he was in the world.
All computers running this operating system had the same time zone.
When you pulled the stick off again, there were no traces of what you had done.
Some people even trusted with their lives that it worked.
With Tails you could do anything you wanted to do anonymously: send e-mails to journalists, chat with hacker friends, surf the Internet on monitored sites or simply write an article for an underground magazine.

Marlene didn't care about any of this now.
She had something else in mind.
And that's why her knees trembled a little.
On her way home from school she had decided not to wait another day.
She opened the terminal program of Tails with a double click.
Some also called it a console or command line.
The terminal program was not a normal program, it was the program that could be used directly with the computer.
You didn't click on any functions with the mouse, you just typed commands and the computer returned answers as text on the screen.
That's all.
No pictures, just text.
But the program had it in it.
All the hackers she knew worked almost exclusively with this program.
There were orders for everything you wanted to do.
One could, for example, penetrate computers on the other side of the world, search for files there, copy them to other computers on other continents, blur one's tracks, jump from there to the next computer.
With the terminal program everything went much faster and more accurate than with the other programs.
And that was now important: to be fast.
That's right.
