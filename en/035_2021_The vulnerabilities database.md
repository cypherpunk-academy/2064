## **2021** The vulnerability database

<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Marlene sat concentrated</span> bent over her laptop.
Another one stood next to it, unfolded.
On the other side a bowl with apples and oranges, a plate with nuts, an open Mate bottle.

"Pling," it came from her computer.
The chat program opened.

Marlene exclaimed, "Muhammad!"

Mohammed: "Hi, Marlene! What's the situation at Boatly? Any enemies nearby?"

Marlene: "Plenty.
But only on the Internet, not yet in the boat.
:) "

Mohammed: "It's getting serious.
The boys and girls are gathering."

Marlene: "I'm excited.
How many?"

Mohammed: "34 have confirmed."

Marlene: "34!!! Wow. Wow.
Awesome!
Shit.
I'm not gonna screw this up.
Not this time.
For Marwin!"

Mohammed: "For Marwin! ... No, for all of us.
We need that thing, Mari.
Since you came up with the idea, it has become stronger and stronger for me that we can't get any further without it.
I want it.
And all the others, too.
That's why 34 come! Julian and Kim are in, too."

Marlene: "Julian and Kim! Wow. Wow.
A dream team.
But I thought they wouldn't miss it."

Mohammed: "Are you done?"

Marlene: "Ready."

Mohammed: "Good.
The whole thing will start in about 15 minutes.
We go simultaneously to 23 institutions, all high security: banks, military, secret services, oil companies, the German government headquarters.
We're going to make hell for 15 more minutes.
All relevant people at the TAO will be looking everywhere.
You'll be busy.
You can count on that.
This is gonna be a riot :-)
Exactly 5 minutes after the start you go in and then after precisely 10 minutes you go out again.
We'll just be a few more minutes.
Just to be safe."

Marlene: "Then, I'll go out again." She placed a digital alarm clock right next to her laptop.

Mohammed: "Okay.
Then I say: GO! 15 minutes, from now on."

Marlene's heart was racing.
She breathed in and out hard.
Put her hands on the keys.
Let the individual steps once again run through her thoughts.
She heard a noise.

"What was that?" she thought.

A bubbling, squeaky noise from the water.
Somebody opened the door.
She breathed briefly and went through the footsteps.
Every one of them.
A diving mask appeared on the surface of the water.
She looked, and then back at her laptop.

"Puhhh.
Achmed," she thought.
"Thank God."

Achmed got out of the water and took off his mask.

Achmed loudly: "Hi Marlene! Long time no see..." He grinned at both ears.
"Look what I got here." He presented a large warming pot.
"Chicken flambe, with a special coconut sauce."

Marlene didn't react.
Achmed put the pot carefully on the ground, went to her and looked over her back.

Achmed: "Oh, a hack! Then I won't disturb you." He sat across the table, pulled out a crumpled paperback, and laid it in front of him.
He looked at Marlene, a little dreamy, and then shook his head in disbelief and admiration: "Such a woman," he thought, "such a bit of luck that I met her."

Marlene's gaze became more focused.
Suddenly her hands started moving.
Fast, incredibly fast.
Achmed was always amazed about it.
And this time it didn't stop.
What did she do? He didn't dare get up.
Marlene switched to the other laptop.
Then back again.
Short break.
Another thunderstorm of keys.
It really sounded a little like hail.

Marlene wiped a bead of sweat off her forehead.
She was inside! In the heart of the TAO, where the vulnerability database was.
The complete database.
She was lying in front of her, and no one was there but her.
The others must have been doing a lot of work right now.
She was alone with the database, 12 networked computers.
Seven minutes and 30 seconds were left.
And their calculations were correct.
The backup file was almost ready.
Every day around this time, this backup was automatically created and then sent to another high-security area.
She wanted to wait for the moment when it was finished and lay there quietly for a few seconds.
Then make a copy, cover the tracks, and get out again.
There! The file was ready.
She typed:


<div style="background-color: #222; color: lightgreen; padding: 20px; margin: 20px 0; font-family: 'Courier New'">
cp 2021_09_12_1403_ebup.gz /tmp1
</div>
The command made a copy of the file.
But it was still on the same computer in the high-security area.
It took endless seconds.
A terabyte of data, descriptions, programs, application examples, computer maps, password files, a huge key file.
Everything was scurrying in those seconds through the inside of the computers in the heart of the TAO, somewhere in America.
And Marlene was sitting in her underwater hideout in the Red Sea.

"Ready!" she shouted out loud.
Achmed looked at her in astonishment.
She didn't respond to him.

"Let's get out of here," she thought.
The chat window pinged.

Mohammed: "Mari! Watch your step! A traffic block is still active, and it's about to close."

Traffic blocks were designed to disable data lines when more data flowed than usual.
And that was the case now.
Marlene thought she had disabled them all, but apparently, there was one left.

Marlene: "How much?"

Mohammed: "5 maybe 6 megabytes."

Marlene: "Shiiiit.
I need a terabyte, a million megabytes.
I have the file here.
Give me room for it.
Can't you turn the lock off?"

Mohammed: "No chance.
I've tried everything."

Marlene: "Do it! Mohammed.
Magic! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! â€¦ "

Mohammed: "I can't.
I can't reach it."

"Yes, you can!" Marlene scurried desperation over her face: "Marwin! Where's Marwin?
I need some help.
Marwin!!!"

A tear came out of her eye.

She wrote, "Muhammad!!
I've got everything here.
Come on.
We're not giving up now.
I want this thing out of here.
Such a fat monster.
A terabyte."

Mohammed: "It doesn't work.
I don't have an idea anymore.
Three minutes to go.
Shit."

Marlene's eyes were filled with tears.
She wiped it off.
Closed his eyes.
Thought about it.
Then she bit her teeth together and started drumming on the keyboard with her fingers again.
She now changes laptops every ten seconds.
From the corner of her eye, she saw that Mohammed had written something, she ignored it.
"We need an airlift," she said out loud to herself.
"Yes! Now I know.
QR codes.
Where's the program?" She drummed into the laptops for a while and then sank back into her chair.
Achmed slipped beside her and put his arm around her shoulder.

Achmed: "Hello! Did you get it?"

"No!" sobbed Marlene.
"No, I don't have it.
Shit."

She hit her legs with all her might.

Marlene: "Almost.
I had it in my hand.
We almost had her."

Achmed embraced her deeply.
You sat like that for a while.

Achmed asked carefully: "QR codes? Airlift?"

Marlene waved: "Yes, I hid the file and installed a program to display it on the screen in QR codes.
Then you could get it out if you placed a QR code scanner on the other side of the screen, and the screen was on."

Achmed: "This is a plan!"

Marlene looked at him helplessly: "But there is no QR code scanner on the other side where the computer is.
And if someone were there, who would start the program?
This is an NSA high-security data center.
And after what happened, we can't get in now."

Achmed: "You can do it! I know that. I know that.
You can do anything you want.
Let's eat something good first."

Marlene shook her head and leaned against his shoulder:
"I'm not hungry."

She stood up and sat down on the floor opposite the wall.
