## **2064** Back in the 20th century

<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">In Fortunato's Beach House.</span> Fortunato was walking around the beach apartment with a high red head.
Jonny was sitting in an armchair.
Two men in black suits stood to his side, overlooking Fortunato and on two life-size monitors showing the two agents Lasse had spoken to in San Diego.
A camera followed Fortunato automatically.

Fortunato: "This is a CATASTROPHE!
I give you two super hackers on a silver platter, and you just let them go.
Ha! You call the CIA Trant√ºten and the NSA Schnarchnasen, and then two hackers escape you with a simple car interplay ...
The first one's already gone, and we haven't had a signal from the second one in 35 minutes."
He showed a display on the wall that showed the names of Lasse and Sigur and behind each of them a map section with a question mark in the middle and a time.

First agent:
"He's at a mall in Phoenix.
It's our turn.
We've got 13 men on the ground in this department store now.
And more than 200 are on their way there as a backup.
He can't get away.
No problem."

Fortunato: "You guys still don't understand what this is about.
This is war.
We have the greatest network of contacts providing us with information from anywhere in the world, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
And the most important of them we get under camouflage.
Not only under camouflage from our enemies, no, also under camouflage from CIA, NSA, most of the government.
Maybe 11 or 12 people in Washington know about us.
That's why we have to protect our people's cover!
That's why we pay them with Bitcoins.
In the year 2028, such a thing does not cost dollars or Euros, that costs Bitcoins, many Bitcoins.
By Monday, the supplies will be used up.
Get away!
Then we can no longer serve our contacts.
We can't just transfer money, we can't take cash anywhere, we can't buy Bitcoins for cash.
We need too much.
We hold over 12 percent of all Bitcoins there are.
Yes!
And 11.9 percent are now in the hands of a 20-year-old who walks around a department store just to escape you."

Second agent: "Access immediately, I say, take him to a safe place and then personally convince him to defuse the other three bombs right now and return the Bitcoins.
Maybe he dies in the process.
But not before he disarms the bombs.
I could be in Phoenix in three hours.
You'll have the money in six hours.

Fortunato with a slightly red head: "Or the shop has flown around our ears.
I don't want to wake up and realize the Bitcoins are gone.
Then we can shut this thing down!
I just explained that to you.
Is somebody listening to me?
There must be another way.

Still can't get into their laptops?
You still don't know where the bombs are?
I mean, this is the gate net, we know the gate net, but we're blind here, completely blind.
We don't know what they're talking about, we don't know what they're doing, we don't know anything, we don't find the bombs, nothing, nothing, nothing.
And now both stations are silent, we don't even have a location.
Are we back in the 20th century now?"

First agent: "I just got the word... We lost him!"

Fortunato: "WAAASSS?" He turned powder red on his face.
"NO! LAPP NOSES! INCAPABLE!
They'll neuter you."

He closed his eyes and then suddenly screamed:
"S C H E I S S E !"
He stepped against one of the giant screens, which fell backward and smashed into thousands of splinters.
He yelled at the agents on the remaining monitor:
"Change of plans! Change of plans. I want him here, I want both of them here now!
We'll do this the old way.
Not that super-secret bureaucratic shit with hundreds of lame asses.
Access!
ACCESS!
Did you hear that? Get them! Get them!
Both of them.
Bring her here.
I want her in this room before sundown today.
I won't go through with this anymore.
We're gonna do this the way we used to do it."
