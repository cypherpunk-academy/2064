## **2064** The Sphinx

[text-caps]#Lilly to Marlene Farras: "Thank you!
The thoughts are of your brother, aren't they?"

Marlene nodded.

Lilly grinned, "If I had a poster in my room, it'd be from him."

Marlene: "He feared that people would do this one day.
I remember when we laughed about it.
But, Lilly ... There's something else, isn't there?"

Lilly laughed. "Yeah, sure! There's something new."

She looked briefly at Lasse and then raised her flat hand towards the audience.
On it appeared a three-dimensional, approximately 15 cm tall, drawn mosquito fly.
Lasse and Sigur had set up a number of 3D projectors in the room with which you could show and move things at any point.

Lilly: "This is Mostafa.
He's one of the masters of the academy."

She threw Mostafa into the air and he fluttered quite excitedly a lap over the audience and then towards the sofa where he sat down next to Lilly on the armchair back, flapped his wings once more and began to speak in a clear, somewhat squeaky and excited voice.

Mostafa: "Hello, hey! My first appearance here.
First of my life ever!
Yeah, what can I say?
I'm Mostafa.
I'm an Asian tiger mosquito."
He flapped his wings.
"And I know a lot about the academy.
Anything at all.
At least everything you need to know about the academy.
I know, for example, what the last four basic ideas are.
Hey, hey.
And I know every entrance, every transition, every exit, every game, every trick.
I've been everywhere.
And... I know the Sphinx! Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
And my colleagues here: Wim, Tin and Wunderlich."

A big bear, an owl and a rat appeared backstage.
The bear jumped over the back of the sofa with an elegant swing and landed with a light smile on his lips next to Marlene on a large cushion.
The owl fluttered upwards and then landed awkwardly between bear and Lilly on the backrest.
And the rat was scurrying around on stage for a while, as if looking for a hiding place, and then disappeared under Lilly's chair.
Shortly afterwards she looked out of there a little shyly.

Lilly: "These are the four game masters of the academy.
Mostafa will show you around.
He explains new things and gives all kinds of comments, you can ask him anything related to the academy." She looked over to Mostafa, who twisted the beak sharply upwards.

"Wim, the bear, is responsible for the learning atmosphere, for ensuring that everyone feels free, that everyone can find their way, that everyone can try out what they want to try.
With him together you play the game of 11 basic thoughts.
For each thought there is a plain island.
He himself lives in the garden of Epicurus on the eleventh level island.
That's where you must try to get there.
The way leads over all eleven islands.
It's a bit like a maze.
You can find out exactly what that is in the game.

Tin the owl knows everything that happened in the liberation struggle.
She knows the whole story, all the cypher punks, all the hacks and above all the general thought mistakes that led to the wars on the Internet.
It will give you programming tasks, thought error puzzles and game orders.
She lives in a magical world, which is nowhere, and which changes when she solves tasks and puzzles or fulfills orders.

And miraculous... miraculous, that's our house-rat.
If you mess up, intentionally or unintentionally, violate rules, put you in a hopeless situation or otherwise, you will get to know him, then you will get a special task together with him.
And because of those duties, he's not very popular either, I'd say..."

Under the armchair you could see a big grin.

Lilly: "You first have to find the academy itself.
She's not really to be missed ... If she shows herself to you ... If you're on certain missions ..."
She grabbed her nose.
"That's all there is to it right now.
I wish you a lot of fun and see you in TRON.
Marlene will be here all evening telling stories and answering all your questions."

Marlene: "Isn't there still something missing?"

Lilly: "What? Ahh. Mh mh. Yes ... Actually, it is."

Lilly looked at Marlene with an acted fearful look.

A dark rumble was heard from outside.
It seemed to come first from one side, then from the other.
It came closer and became louder and suddenly, with an enormous flash and a tremendous crash, the wall collapsed behind the stage, at least it seemed so.
Drawn boulders of stone rolled through the room.
Everything was filled with fog.
Bright light dazzled the audience, nobody could see exactly what was going on.
The owl slowly turned towards the light, the bear continued to sit quietly on the sofa and watched the spectators, there was nothing to see of the rat and Mostafa demonstratively rolled his eyes.
All spectators looked excitedly into the light, where a giant bird shape appeared and slowly became clearer..."

"The Sphinx!" Lilly shouted.

Mostafa grumbled next to her: "She can't come normal once like everyone else.
Not even when the academy's inaugurated.
Such a poop nose."
