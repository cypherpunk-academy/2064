## **2021**** Alone

<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Marlene was lying </span> on the bed in her brother's basement bedroom.
The room had radio-save walls, the power grid was filtered.
Her brother had also installed a small toilet room, a refrigerator, and some other changes.
Next to the bed was a desk with two large computer monitors.

Marlene hadn't heard from Corinne in three days.
Three long days.
She had spent most of the time in Marvin's basement.
Corinne's chat account had remained silent.
Maybe she couldn't use it anymore, maybe it was too dangerous for her, maybe she just didn't want to talk to her anymore.
It was a betrayal of her friendship, but how could she have known that the addresses were so sensitive?

In the meantime everyone in her family had received an e-mail from her brother.
It said he was fine.
And it was digitally signed with his personal key.
No one around Marlene doubted its authenticity.
He wrote that he would disappear for a while, travel around the world, that he needed time to think, to rethink everything he had done.
And he just wanted to leave, without a big farewell party, it had all been too much for him.
Just keep his distance from everything in the past and especially from hacking.
The BND thing had become too stressful for him.

And in fact, his room was missing a suitcase and some of his things.
He didn't write a word about the police or whoever picked him up in the car.
Marlene had read the e-mail a hundred times.
To find any hidden clue.
In the end, she had had so much stomach pain that she burnt it.
THis letter wansn't written by her brother!
That much she knew.
He wouldn't write that kind of nonsense, and he wouldn't just walk away.
His key was hanging in the hallway like he would be home.
Someone else must have put it back there and got the stuff, too.
A shiver ran down her spine.
She knew that they would break into apartments.
You're not safe anywhere.
Her brother told her that.
But it was something completely different when it actually happened.

No one believed her.
Not that someone brought the key back and took his things, not the car that stopped in broad daylight.
All police stations in Berlin said that none of their cars was in this street at the time.
And the car with the license plate Marlene had remembered was at the same time on a fire brigade mission in another part of town.
In the end, they didn't even believe that she had walked home with him that day.
It was so spooky.
Where was Marwin?
How was he?
What had they done to him?
What are they just now doing to him?
Was he even alive?
She had all this questions, and no one to talk to.

All the others, her parents and her uncle, neighbors, were not worried at all.
They were even a little mad at Marwin for just leaving.
But that he may have a horrible time now?
Marlene kept crying.
Crying was the only thing she could do when she got stuck.
Crying and the story of Hilde from the First World War.
Why didn't anybody believe her?
How well do you have to know someone that you can trust him in a situation like this?
Her brother would have trusted her.
Dead sure.
But your own parents?
Not?
They had brought in a psychologist, Marlene had talked to her, hoping that she would notice that everything was fine with her.
But in the end she had said that Marlene had post-traumatic stress syndrome because of the loss of her brother.
She would change reality to fit the image of her brother instead of accepting how he really was.

Marwin was gone.
That was bad.
But worse was what happened to him now.
And with Corinne...

"Pling," said her chat program.

"Hi, Mari! All's well with you?" appeared on the screen.

"Corinne!" called Marlene and stared spellbound at her laptop.
