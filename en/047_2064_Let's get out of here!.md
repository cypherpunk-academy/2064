## **2064**** Let's get out of here!

In a taxi.

<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">"Stop the car!"</span> Lasse yelled at the driver.
Sigur next to him choked.
He opened the door, stumbled out and vomited.
Then he crouched down on the spot for a few moments.
Lasse came from behind and picked him up: "Come, think something, anything, that we really get out of here now, we will sit in the plane, home ... come, just a little more ..."
He pulled him back into the taxi.

Sigur was as white as chalk, his eyes blacked out.
He kept clenching his fists and shaking his head in anger.

Lasse: "Come on ... hold on ... just another ten minutes."

The driver didn't drive to the main entrance of the airport, but through a service sluice.
A man with a baggage car was waiting behind it.
Lasse and Sigur took their backpacks and climbed onto the car.
The man handed them a bottle of water without a word, which Sigur happily took, nodded to them and drove them straight to their gate, where a steward was waiting at the stairs.

Steward: "No suitcases?
All the easier.
Follow me."

They went up the stairs together, nobody seemed to care about them.
Lasse and Sigur found a seat on a bench in front of the gate counter and dropped onto the bench.
Back in the normal world.
People waiting for a flight, immersed in smartphones, one had a laptop with Facebook.
The display above the gate counter said: 

Expected departure time: 13:35.

Lasse shook his head and said quietly: "One hour later than planned ... Fortunato".

Sigur leaned his head against Lasse's shoulder and closed his eyes.

"He had never done that before," Lasse thought and put his arm around him.

After about 45 minutes the flight was called.
They stood in line passing the gate counter.
Lasse showed his ID and ticket and was waved through.
Sigur was about to do the same when a man in a suit grabbed his shoulder from behind.
Sigur turned in panic.
Two huge security officers stood in front of him, bodybuilders with buttons and ringlets on their ears.
A thrid one walked with big steps towards Lasse, who had turned around.

Security officer to Sigur: "We have a few questions for you."

Sigur held his breath, panicking, trying to think: "Where's an escape route?"
He looked left and right.
But the second security officer was already standing behind him and grabbed him firmly by the shoulder.

Second security officer: "Come with me, please!"

Lasse stormed towards Sigur, but the third security officer in front of him intercepted him.
In the officer's arms, he stared panically to where Sigur was dragged away, but he could not follow.

Officer to Lasse: "Easy, boy!
Be calm!
There is no chance to get to him now anyway.
Get on the plane!
There's nothing for you here."

Lasse tried everything to get away.
He yelled, but the man held him tight.
Only when the other two men with Sigur had disappeared behind a door did he let him go.
Lasse ran towards the door and shook the handle.
It was locked and noone answered.
He stepped against the door.
Nothing.
Only a few passengers looked surprised as they passed by.

He leaned against the wall and slowly slid down until he sat.
Then he put his hands in front of his face.
