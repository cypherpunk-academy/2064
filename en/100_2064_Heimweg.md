The sun went down behind the games laboratory and bathed the entire school grounds in a golden light.
Lasse and Sigur jumped over the stream that flowed around the house.
Behind them came Marlene and Lilly.
They walked two and two down the main path of the school grounds and talked excitedly, with many gestures and full of joy.
Lasse let herself fall back and said something to Marlene.
She nodded.
He stopped, covered his eyes and laughed.
