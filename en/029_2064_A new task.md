## **2064** A new task

<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lasse and Sigur</span> ran up the grass path to a round hut standing on a big rock.
The evening sun completely illuminated the hut.
It consisted of a circle of man-high stones and a shingled wooden roof on wooden stilts.
It was open to the sunny side.
There was a campfire burning in the middle.
Lilly sat in front of the hut on the rock and looked into a vast landscape of fields, gardens, houses, and a lake.

Lilly called them both welcome: "Hej, hej, just go inside.
She's waiting."

Lasse and Sigur went left and right past the campfire into the hut.
Inside, Marlene waited on a big pillow, in front of her a small table with tea.
She greeted her with a warm smile.

Marlene: "Sit down.
Have some tea."

She watched the two of them pour their tea.
Lasse liked being here in this hut.
It had a unique atmosphere.
Maybe it was the big stones, or the beautiful, very asymmetrical wooden roof, perhaps it was just Marlene's smile.
He could get quiet inside here.
Sigur was here for the first time.
He didn't really feel well, didn't understand what it was all for and why he should come here.
He would much rather have simply read in the match report what had happened and what the consequences were.
Simple, matter-of-fact, not some fuss around it.
What difference does it make when you sit in such a virtual hut?
More than in the match report could not happen here.

Lasse: "Marlene ..."

She interrupted, "I know, Lasse."

She took a pencil and drew with it on a sheet of paper in front of her a five-star, with a star point open.

Marlene: "Do you know what this is?"

Sigur shrugged his shoulders, "A Five Star."

Marlene pointed to the vacancy.

Lasse: "The sign had the combat robots in front on the top.
But you have to turn it around.
The vacancy must be on top."

Marlene nodded: "Exactly! That's the Sorat Rangers' sign.
They are always five."

Lasse: "The Sorat Rangers!
Five.
Are you saying that that was the Sorat Rangers? Fuck.
No. No.

Sigur: "No.
No way. No way.
They weren't."

Marlene grabbed her nose and said, "Why not?"

Sigur: "The Sorat Rangers are an elite unit of the CIA, they are _the_ elite combat robot unit of the CIA.
They come when there's something big going on.
And when they come, they clean up.
They have an efficiency of 100%.
All missions successfully completed, never lost a robot.
We don't just take them from heaven without preparation.
They're the best of the best.
We would need twenty flying combat robots, and then well-programmed formations, a good tactic.
But not me and Lasse just like that, from a standing start.
Forget it, man.
TRON is realistic."

Marlene: "If the Sorat Rangers were what they're supposed to be, you'd be right.
Then that would probably have ended badly for you.
But you're not.
I'm sorry you fell for the CIA intimidation propaganda.
The Sorat Rangers are a group responsible for assassinations, not for real ones.
They do not have to be the best of the best to always be successful, because their orders are all placed.
They are good pilots, but not the absolute elite.
That's how it is in TRON, and it really was."

Lasse: "In reality? You were real? It was real?"

Marlene nodded: "Mhmh.
And when you caught them today, the formation was on its way to a mission that actually took place in 2027.
A meeting of presidents and army leaders of the Middle East, in Kandahar.
At that moment, they were being attacked by other combat robots, by Russian ones, but in reality, they were also attacked by the CIA, or
a CIA friendly intelligence agency.
It was probably the Mossad.
We don't know for sure.
Anyway, after this, it went horrible.
In TRON and also in reality.
Because the Five Star isn't coming.
They'll be shot down shortly before that.
A few minutes earlier.
We don't know why it really was like that... in TRON we do.
In TRON, you were.
What is happening right now is that due to some misunderstandings in the control center and two wrong commands, the whole assembly is bombed into the air.
Everything will be razed to the ground.
There were 122 deaths.
Seven of them presidents."

Lasse: "The Middle East War! Then came the Middle East War!"

Sigur: "With the atomic bomb on Salina.
Shit."

Marlene: "Not yet.
Something's missing."

Lasse and Sigur looked at Marlene.

Marlene: "The masterminds of this sham attack must not remain hidden.
It has to be clear that all this was fake and went in the pants.
A then, then the war comes.
Or something else will come.
And you shall..."

Lasse: "...we are to uncover this.
We're supposed to find out who did this at the CIA."

Sigur: "What else would come if it weren't for the Middle East War?"

Marlene: "No, not in the CIA.
There's a previously unknown intelligence agency in the United States responsible for this.
The CIA is just a cover in this case.
The Sorat Rangers are flying for unknown intelligence.
And you have to find him.
That's the job.
Go to that conference in Caracas in three days and meet a Frederick Peterson at that exact time in that place.
Then you'll have a chance."

She gave Lasse a note.

Lasse looked at her: "Venezuela?"

Sigur: "And if it comes differently? Then won't the atomic bomb be dropped?"

Marlene: "I know what you're thinking:
You should ensure that there is a war in which a nuclear bomb is detonated, and many people die.
You don't have to do this.
You have to think for yourself and decide what you feel is right.
I'm just saying find out and make it known that there's this as yet unknown secret service.
And how he works."

Lilly stood in the entrance and gave Marlene a sign.

Marlene: "Okay.
I gotta go. I gotta go.
Good luck to you, Cypherpunks."

She got up and went out.
Lasse followed her after a short time.

"I'm not a Cypherpunk," Sigur mumbled and trotted out of the hut behind Lasse.
