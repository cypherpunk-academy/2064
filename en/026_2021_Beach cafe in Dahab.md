## **2021** Beach cafe in Dahab

<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Marlene sat up </span> some seat cushions in a beach café in Dahab, a small tourist nest at the Red Sea.
She leaned back and thought about the journey from Berlin to this place.
It had taken three months.
She had hitchhiked most of the way.
Once she was able to fly in a tiny private plane.
On the journey, she wore only hippie clothes.
She smiled at the thought.

On the low table in front of her was a laptop and another on her lap.
She looked out over the sea, at the kite surfers, who were doing their rounds right in front of the café and then behind them at the slightly blurred coastline of Saudi Arabia on the other side of the sea.
She was alone in the café.
Only Achmed, the bartender, was just behind the counter preparing a milkshake.
Achmed was in his mid-twenties, with fluffy black hair and always an inconspicuous smile on his lips.

With some elegant steps, he approached Marlene with the milkshake and placed it in front of her on the table.
In the meantime, she had sunk back into her laptop and didn't seem to notice it.
He looked at her for a while and then sat next to her, at which point she turned to him in surprise.
He smiled warmly.

Achmed: "Achmed!" He reached out his hand to her.
She took it a little hesitantly.

Marlene: "Waltraut."

Achmed: "Woldraud?"

Marlene: "Wal-t-rau-t."

He nodded to her nicely.

The bartender pointed to the milkshake: "It's on me!"

"Why?" she asked and looked at him.
He got a little insecure.

Bartender: "You're here for two weeks today.
It's a celebration! And I'm celebrating that after two weeks I finally know your name."

Marlene smiled, "Thank you!"

Achmed: "You are from Germany?"

Marlene looked at him surprised, shrugged her shoulders.
Then she smiled at him and turned back to her laptop.

He sat silently next to her for a while and then said: "Hej, you haven't met anybody here all this time and you've hardly spoken anything except when you want something to drink and something to eat, or to say that no one should bother you."

She looked at him again.

Achmed: "And that's not possible here! This is the Eel Garden Café.
This is where people talk to each other.
It's not good not to talk to each other.
It's not good to be alone.
For example, I'd like to know what you're doing.
You use strange programs.
Just colorful words and stuff.
No movies, no Facebook.
A friend of mine is doing the same thing.
He's a hacker.
Sure, you know what hackers are? He's a real hacker!"

Marlene: "Mohammed."

Achmed nodded in surprise.

Marlene: "I'm here because of him.
He told me you were okay.
The best place for me here in Dahab."

Achmed looked at her in amazement: "He, he didn't tell me anything."

Marlene: "I didn't mean it."

Achmed: "Then, you are also a hacker?"

Marlene: "A hacker."

Achmed looked at her with her mouth slightly open.
Pling! It sounded from the bar.

Achmed: "Oh, a guest.
I'll be right back.
Stay here!"

Marlene turned back to her laptop.
It was just so exciting.
She had made some significant strides in the last few days.
She was able to draw a map of a computer network within the TAO, the elite hacker group in the NSA.
She had added two more computers this morning.
She was there in a very, very central place.
This place was incredibly secure, like Fort Knox.
Nothing could just be smuggled in or out unnoticed.
There had to be something valuable, something they wanted to protect by all means.

Since she was on the run, she got much better access to everything: passwords, keys, programs, successful hacks.
It was incredible.
Help came from everywhere.
There was, in fact, the hidden network of hackers.
She knew that now.
And she also knew that she was known there by now.
She had a good reputation, she was trusted.
And since then she only had to ask questions, and a few hours or days later, she had an answer or even a program.
The only thing she hadn't found out yet, but wanted to know, was how her brother Marwin was doing.
All she knew by now was that he was alive, somewhere in the United States.
But the fact that she hadn't found out anymore now spurred her on rather than depressing her.
She felt the power of this dark community, people who lived anonymously, who risked their lives for ... yes, for what? For a better, more humane way of dealing with each other, for better cooperation, for less injustice, more openness.
Yeah, for a new way of living together.
And this community was incredibly powerful.

Achmed, the bartender, had liked her from the beginning, but she had decided to keep her distance.
He had nothing to do with any of this, he'd hardly understand.
But Mohammed said that she could trust him with everything, with everything! It was strange that Mohammed said that.
But that meant a lot to her.

She talked to Mohammed several times a day, a lot of personal things.
It was good to talk about feelings, also about Achmed, about his funny black curls and his warm eyes, how insecure he was towards her and how he always cheated on guests.
He was best when they realized it.
He always made it out somehow.
And most of them came back after that.

To write Mohammed, she used Pond, an email program that was made for Tails.
She didn't have much choice in how to communicate anymore, she was quite high on the worldwide intelligence wanted list.
But Pond trusted her.
As soon as it was started, Pond would send evenly-sized packets of messages to the Tor network at irregular intervals.
Whether she had just written a message or not.
If not, then empty messages were sent.
No one could find out from the outside whether someone was sending something or not, not even to whom or how much.
And in the net the parcels of all Pond users, which could not be distinguished from the outside, rushed all over the place between the gate nodes, it was impossible to assign them to individual Pond users.
Hopeless chaos - for secret services.

"Now!" Achmed fell on a pillow next to her.
"Tell.
What do you do? Will you help Mohammed?"

Marlene: "Sometimes."
She smiled at him and thought she liked to talk to Achmed after all.
Her brother had told her that what "they" want, by which he meant mostly the secret services, is that we communicate less with each other, more cautiously or even not at all anymore.
What we want, however, he said, is that we can communicate freely as much as we want.

Marlene: "I program a bit, keep my computer free from intruders, and I'm trying to find out which computers are in a specific computer network and what they do.
And maybe how I get in there."

Achmed: "Sounds exciting.
I don't know anything about that.
But I can cook and dive, I was 65 meters deep last week, at night.
That's awesome.
It makes you feel like you're in space.
You float weightlessly in the darkness.
It's a whole different world down there."

"Pling," it sounded from the bar.

Achmed: "Shit.
Lots going on today.
"Will you program something for me?" He jumped up and hurried to the bar.
She smiled after him.
