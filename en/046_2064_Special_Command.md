## **2064** Special Command

<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">In the games lab.</span>
Lasse and Sigur stood opposite each other with glass spheres on their heads in front of their floating monitors.

Lasse took his sphere and placed it on the table in front of him: "Sigur!
Are you sleeping, too?"

Sigur also put the sphere down: "Yes.
I'm dreaming.
But nothing special.
That'S quite nicely programmed in TRON.
Beautiful, colorful.
You?

Lasse: "With me at one point everything turned black.
Funny.
Completely dark.
I only hear a wobbling sound, very quiet.
A bit like I'm on drugs.
I can't see anything.
Everything dark black.
Also smelling and tasting is gone."

Sigur: "Hmmm.
All gone?
I haven't had that yet.
No idea what that is.
Now something seems to happen to me.
The images change.
Wow.
Full motion ... Oh!
I must put the sphere back on.
I wake up ... in 30 seconds."

The door to the game room opened.
Edgar, her communication and movement teacher came in.
Both turned to him.
He put his finger on his mouth and told them to keep playing.
He went to Sigur, stood close by his side and laid his hand on his shoulder.

Sigur turned to him: "Is something awful coming now?

Edgar nodded: "But you can just keep playing.
It's going to get a little blatant.
You can go all the way in there.
No problem.
I'm here."

Sigur breathed deeply and looked deeper into his dreams.

It was 5:45.
Fortunato sat alone in the living room of the beach apartment and played with a magic cube.
He heared a soft sound of a vehicle outside.
He rose, went to the front door and opened it quietly.
Seven men from a task force entered the apartment, fully equipped with assault rifles and helmet.
The last one carried two large medicine cases.
Fortunato led them quietly up the stairs.

Fortunato to the squad leader: "To the right is Lasse.
To the left Sigur.
Lasse is in deep sleep, I gave him gas.
Sigur sleeps normally."

The squad leader opened quietly the right door and made a sign to the last soldier.
The soldier carried the medicine cases into the room.
He knelt next to Lasse and checked his breath and pulse.
Then he turned Lasse's head to the side and put a kind of vaccination pistol on the back of his head.
He closed his eyes and pulled the trigger.
After a short, dangerous-sounding "click" he put the gun down, wiped away the blood that had dropped out of the tiny wound.
He glued the crack with a kind of glue.
Then he reached into the suitcase and took out a hand-sized device with a screen.
He turned it on, pulled out two antennas and briefly observed the pulsating signals that appeared on the screen.
He gave the squad leader a sign that everything was okay.

The squad leader turned to Sigur's door and counted down from three with his fingers.
At zero, the first soldier entered the door and four more stormed after him into the room with a loud roar.
Two soldiers brutally turned Sigur on his belly and fixed his arms behind his back with plastic cuffs.
One soldier held his weapon directly to Sigur's head, another held a strong lamp in his face.
Sigur could hardly see something.
He had a numb feeling in his head, the light, the screams, the brutal hands on his arms and legs, the many soldiers around him - everything still seemed somehow far away.
Then he heard a voice calling:

Squad leader: "Mr. Alvas!
Mr. Alvas!
Do you hear me?

Sigur turned his head to him and looked at him with one eye.

"Mr. Alvas," the squad leader took a chair and sat next to him.
"Listen to me!
Do you hear me?
Nod when you hear me!

Sigur did not react.
One of the two soldiers holding him turned his arm.
Sigur groaned painfully and tried to nod.

Squad leader: "Okay.
Mr. Alvas, you've done some very stupid things.
You should know that you did things that some very powerful people don't approve.
Maybe you just ignored that, maybe you didn't.
It doesn't matter.
If you thought that you could fuck us with this, that you could get into security systems, take them over and get away with it, then you are mistaken.
Obviously.
Otherwise I wouldn't be here now."

Sigur with pain: "Who are you?"

The squad leader gave a signal to a soldier next to him and he hit Sigur firmly on the head with his hand.
Sigur screamed.

Squad leader: "_I_ ask the questions.
You wait and give answers.
- I could ask you a few questions now to find out a little more about what you did.
Unfortunately, we don't have any known gaps in our knowledge.
We know everything we want to know about you.
And that's a lot.
So ... I'm not here to ask questions.
I'm here to make a deal with you.
Naturally, in the situation we find ourselves in, the deal will be rather one-sided.
There will not be many advantages on your side, but at least one:
You will survive.
Otherwise it's more about commitments.
But you will sign anyway.
Not with a pen, not on paper, nor yourself.
We will do that for you.
Into your body, with such a small ball.
You see this?

He held a bead about five millimeters in diameter in front of Sigur's face.
He had turned away and did not react.
He received another blow to the head and then turned to the squad leader.

Squad leader: "Such a bead, a marvel of technology and a nice invention from our torture chambers, ah, excuse me, from our rooms for advanced interrogation techniques.
There's a radio controller built in and a multifunction processor.
And we programmed it to do two things above all else.
First, it reports your geo position and other body data such as heartbeat, blood pressure, etc. on request.
and second, he can burst the capsule at any time, and then about half a gram of potassium cyanide enters her body.
Then you experience a death struggle lasting about one to two hours.
And it is one of the most unpleasant things you can imagine.
You think you will be torn apart ... into small pieces ... for real.
Oh yes, and if you should come up with the idea of staying in a room that is shielded from radio waves: After about twenty minutes without radio contact, the capsule will also open.
It needs the contact to us.
We always want to know where you are and how you are doing.
So, no more than 20 minutes without radio contact, remember that.
We don't want you to die early."

Sigur tried to free himself, tore his shoulders back and forth, kicked his legs.
The soldiers forced him onto the bed.
He almost lost consciousness because of the pain.

Squad leader: "We can do this with pain, or relatively unspectacular.
Your decision.
What do you want?
He bent close to Sigur's ear.
"Hmm?"
He gave another sign and the soldiers turned Sigur violently on his back.
They fixed his body to the bed with tape.
The soldier with the medicine cases came, put them in front of Sigur and opened them.
Then he took a chair, sat down and took out a syringe.
He stabbed it into the side of Sigur's stomach.

Soldier: "This is a local anaesthetic.
You won't feel any pain."

He opened Sigur's trousers and pulled up his shirt so that his stomach was exposed.
Sigur wriggled.
Then he saw the medical soldier with a long, slender scalpel once stab into his belly and then with a pair of tweezers push the bead into the bleeding gap.
Sigur estimated the depth to about four to five centimeters.
Then the medical soldier desolated the wound with a pen and wiped away the blood.

Medical soldier: "You'll have pain for a few days, a bruise, but it won't be life-threatening.
The capsule has small barbs that make it impossible to pull it out without breaking the bead.
If the barbs break off, the cyanide also enters your body.
So be careful with it.
A punch in the stomach or sport is not enough.
The hooks react very resistant to pressure.
Only pulling is not possible.
So you better not do yoga."

Sigur felt sick.
He wanted to vomit.
His body jerked back and forth.
He himself had actually already given up.
But the body still resisted.
He just managed to turn his head a little to the side before the gush of vomit splashed out of his mouth and hit the floor in front of the bed and the squad leader.

The quad leader jumped up: "Fuck you!
Watch out!"
A soldier hit Sigur against his head again.

Squad leader: "That's disgusting!
Uah."
He looked at himself from top to bottom and then took the towel that the medical soldier gave him.
He began to wipe himself with it.
"Such a mess."

The medical soldier took out the measuring device again, checked the data of the bead in Sigur's stomach and then wrapped it up again.

Medical soldier: "Ready!
He threw the remaining things into the suitcases, closed them and left the room.
The other soldiers followed him.
The squad leader was the last in the room, looking at Sigur:
"Don't fuck around, we're watching you.
Three men will look at your monitor around the clock."

Then he put tape on Sigur's mouth and left the room.

Sigur whimpered.
He tried to free himself, but it didn't work.
He tried to scream, but he couldn't get out more than a dull tone.
Lasse seemed to sleep so deep that he didn't notice anything.

A few hours later did Lasse wake up.
He heard strange noises from the next room.
Squeaking, rumbling.
His head felt like after an excessive beer evening, at least that's how he imagined it, because he had never really been drunk before.
He stood up and felt a pulling pain in his head.
He staggered.

"What's the matter," he thought.
He went to Sigur's door, opened it and saw him tied to the bed, with a red head, wriggling.
Lasse jumped to him, tore the tape from his mouth and opened the plastic cuffs with a knife he found in Sigur's backpack.

Sigur stood up and sat down on the edge of the bed.
He took a deep breath.
"They bugged me!
These assholes.
Fortunato!
I have a capsule in my stomach.
They said there was cyanide in it."

Lasse: "Oh, shit ... God, no!
He sat down next to him.
Fuck!
Who was that?"

Sigur: "A swat team with a doctor: five to eight people.
I don't know anymore.
It was like in a movie."

Lasse: "Was Fortunato there?"

Sugur: "What are you asking?
Of course not.
But he has his hand in this, definitely!

Lasse: "But they didn't take you with them!

Sigur: "No, apparently not."
He looked down at himself.

Suddenly they heard a soft whimper from the lower floor.
Both of them listened up.

Lasse looked carefully around the corner, went down the stairs into the living room.
Fortunato lay on one of the armchairs, tied at his hands and feet, with tape over his mouth and a similar red head as Sigur.
Lasse jumped to him and freed him.
Fortunato let himself sink into the armchair and rubbed his arms.
Sigur came along, and so the three sat around the living room table, just like the night before.

Fortunato, breathed heavily: "With you I make such experiences!

Lasse and Sigur looked at each other.
Sigur closed his eyes, shook his head slightly and hissed to Lasse: "I just want to get out of here."
Lasse nodded.

Fortunato: "I haven't had a raid in five years!
I know people.
Nobody raids me.
They were US-Americans."

Lasse: "That wasn't a raid.
That was an intelligence operation."
He and Fortunato looked at each other.
Lasse looked at the living room clock.
"12:15 pm.
Shit.
Shit!
Our plane is gone."

Fortunato: "When did it leave?"

Lasse: "It leaves at 12:35."

Fortunato: "No problem!
Do you want to get it?
That's still possible."

"Yes, I want," Sigur said with a dark face.

Lasse: "But it's not enough time anyway.
We have to go there and check in and ..."

Fortunato: "The airport is just around the corner, 30 minutes.
I postpone the departure by one hour.
Then you don't have to hurry."

Lasse looked at him.
Sigur nodded and Fortunato picked up the phone and talked to three different people on the phone.

Fortunato: "Taxi arrives in 10 minutes.
Guys, are you all right?
You look bad, Sigur."

Sigur: "Everything okay.
I just slept badly.
I'll go and get my things."

10 minutes later the taxi honked in front of the door, Lasse and Sigur left the apartment with their backpacks on their backs.
Lasse turned around and waved briefly.
Sigur didn't.

Fortunato dropped into an armchair and took a deep breath: "Such an thing!
It's always like that with those gringos."
He shook his head.
"First a club mate and then I look in the shop to see what's happened."
He grabbed his tablet and smiled: "Hej!
622 Bitcoins!
Since yesterday afternoon.
Wow!
This thing has traction."

He took another deep breath and entered the password for his Bitcoin vault.

In the game room, Edgar took his hand off Sigur's shoulder and left the room without a word.
