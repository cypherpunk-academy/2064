## **2064** Vault breach

<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Sigur closed his eyes</span> and grinned into himself.
He wrote in his chat window: "Lasse! Whoa! Whoa! Wowowow! Look, here!"

Lasse instinctively turned to him, but then immediately turned calmly back to his monitor, on which a video film was playing.
He had placed his chat window over the video film, barely noticeable.
There, data scrolled page by page.

Lasse: "What's that??"

Sigur stretched out on his armchair and typed: "Bitcoins! That's where all the Bitcoins from the shop go.
They're masses."

Lasse: "Really? Great!"

Sigur: "But unfortunately encrypted in a Veracrypt file.
It's clear: all of the shop's revenues go into it.
I've looked through the Bitcoin blockchain: There must be hundreds of thousands or maybe even millions of Bitcoins in there."

Lasse: "Billions of euros.
Great! ... Scary ... But what's in it for us? We can't access a Veracrypt file.
Or do you think he has a weak password?"

Sigur: ":-)"

Sigur: ":-D"

Sigur: ":-P"

Sigur: "No.
I don't think he has a weak password.
I can run a password cracker on the side, but I don't think that's going to work.
This is all very professionally done.
Looks like intelligence work, maybe even directly TAO.
But I've just got the Go program on the wrap that brings the Bitcoins from the shop into the vault.
The log files say that he usually starts the program once a day, in the morning, and then he enters the password for the Bitcoin vault.
And then I let it automatically start a small program that doesn't write the newly earned coins into the safe but takes them together with all the other Bitcoins from the safe and sends them into my little cave to my home, into my little Raspberry Pi, my faithful helper over the years.
You know him.
:-) "

Lasse: "You're crazy!
You're gonna steal all of it?
You want to place your own program at this place?
That's striking."

Sigur: "No.
Hiding files is my specialty.
My program will sleep first.
I send him a ping every day to keep him asleep: If that comes, it won't wake up.
Only when it fails once, then it strikes: Wumms!"

"WROOOMS," they heard a car slam outside.
Both were frightened and looked first in the direction of the car and then at each other.
It was the Fortunato pickup.

Lasse: "Shit! Now of all times."

Sigur didn't say a word.
He put on his headphones and went into his laptop.

Fortunato unlocked the front door and came in with a big bag under his arm.

Fortunato: "Hi, boys! Up until this late? Don't you want to go to bed?" He laughed.
"Nah, sure, hackers are night workers." I got you some local stuff.
He put the bag on the living room table in front of Sigur and Lasse.

"Thank you!" Lasse said and reached for it.
It was full of nuts, chocolate, bananas, oranges, a papaya and some bags of chips.

Fortunato: "Sigur? Well?
Sigur didn't move and kept typing on his keyboard.

Lasse looked at Fortunato and said: "Plugged in! There's nothing you can do."
He stuffed his mouth with nuts and grinned at Fortunato.

Fortunato nodded and let himself fall into the third chair that stood on the other side of the table.

Fortunato: "And? How is it working here?
Caribbean beach, panoramic view, own boat mooring.
You can stand it there, can't you?
You're welcome to stay here for a few more days."

Lasse: "Nope.
We leave in the morning.
Our flights leave around 12."

Fortunato: "Okay.
I'll take care of your cab.
You don't have to be there as much soon as usual.
I've got my extra entrance there.
No waiting, no suitcase control.
So, if you want to take any more coke, I'd be happy to..."

Lasse smiled: "Taxi gladly.
Coke, thank you, no."

Fortunato: "What does Sigur actually do?"

Lasse: "He programs.
Again determines some such guard program that waits on a computer for a specific event and then becomes active.
And until it becomes active, it is so well hidden that it doesn't even find the TAO.
And after it runs, it erases itself from the computer, and you don't find any traces.
That's Sigur's specialty.
Nobody does it better than him.
You hate him for it.
It's pure magic."

Fortunato smiled a little tortured.

Fortunato: "Mh mh.
Don't you think we could do a little project together?
Something exciting.
To have fun.
I have some projects where I could use something like this.
And you can make a lot of money on the side."

Lasse smiled back: "Perhaps. If you renounce your cooperation with the NSA and other intelligence agencies, tell us everything you know about the LBI, then gladly."

Fortunato: "Why do you want to go the brutal way if you want to change things?
I also find a lot of what happens in the world stinks to me, even in the secret services.
Believe me, I've taken out some brutality where I'm active.
People treat each other more respectfully.
The cocaine trade was much more brutal ten years ago.
I also want a more peaceful world where as many people as possible can party and work what they want.
But nevertheless, just when I want to change something, I go into the house to the door and greet the host, I am friendly.
I'm not going through the window on the second floor, or breaking through the wall and pulling everything out that I find in there.
There's a little mess in every house.
That can't be avoided.
But that's usually not bad will.
The only thing you achieve with all this publicity is that everyone wakes up and then it gets more brutal.
Why are you doing this?
It's better to change things from the inside.
The "not-against" is one of the Cypherpunk ideals, isn't it?
I don't like a lot of what's going on, for example, that some people are still killing or commissioning people without hesitation.
This is stupid, this is sick.
The LBI accepts the death of thousands of people every year.
And they say, "Otherwise, more people would die. They say Americans would die otherwise.
And then I tell them: Hello, and when I die, it's not so bad.
I may be American, but from the South, a South American, and they're less valuable to you.
But they think that every country considers its own people more valuable.
Every country has the task of caring for its own citizens.
That's the price of being a free country."

Lasse: "You have contact with ... LBI?"

Fortunato: "Of course I did.
Otherwise, I'd be bad at my job.
Hey! Hey!
I'm not a little light.
Neither are you little lights on your territory.
The LBI buys people's whereabouts from me.
I do a lot more precise than the NSA.
In any case, less complicated and faster.
They send me an email address or a cell phone number, and they get a link to a Tor hidden service where they can check their current whereabouts and everyone else in the last eight to nine years.
I'm working on getting all the security cameras in there, too.
There are now great dealers who offer you 30 to 40 percent of all surveillance cameras in a city like Caracas: location, direction, range. Everything they've recorded over the years.
If you know exactly where someone is, you can display the appropriate surveillance camera images.
Live.
Then you can track where the guy or girl is right now and what it's doing.
"I'm telling you, it's a great technique."

Lasse looked at Fortunato and said, "Can I see what this looks like?"

He took a breath.
"What do you mean?
A surveillance site?
Okay. (laughs)
Do you have an email address or a phone number?"

Lasse pondered, grabbed his nose and then said in a slightly hasty tone: "strider4@posteo.de".
He looked at Fortunato.

"A little moment," Fortunato said, "it'll take a minute or two."

Lasse shook his head, "Just a minute or two, shit..."

Sigur wrote: "I get all angry.
I'll slam his throat.
He has zero respect for privacy.
Zero points zero."

Fortunato moaned quietly: "Uh.
He's dead. He's gone.
Died May 17, 2024.
That's Ammonium, that's his hacker name."

He looked at Lasse questioningly.

Lasse: "Exactly.
I'd like to see the surveillance cameras from May 17, 2024.
About 4:30."

Fortunato groaned loudly: "You wanted to see how the system works.
And now we're unveiling again.
It's not my thing.
I'm not tearing down walls.
I can show you the pictures from May 16."

Leave excited: "You have the pictures.
Isn't it?
You know what happened there."

Fortunato: "No, I don't have them.
I erased it.
The whole of May 17 has been erased.
Everyone deleted it."

Lasse's face turned red.
"AND THAT's OKAY?
Delete history?
Lies?
Manipulate?
That was a friend of mine, of both of us.
And I mean, my friend.
We trusted him with our lives.
He used to watch my laptop sometimes.
I would have trusted him with my life.
And then he is pushed in front of a tram and dies, and all the pictures of it are gone, nothing there.
We've looked everywhere for it.
Townhall, shops, railroads, everything was gone.
Just gone.
That's bullshit.
And you're in on it!
That's bullshit!"

Fortunato: "I didn't push him.
And if I hadn't deleted them, my contacts with the clients would have been frozen.
You're tough as nails.
If they want to delete something, you have to do it, or you're out.
And not just for a while, but forever."

Sigur wrote, "Trouser pisser."

Lasse: "But you've seen the pictures?"

Fortunato: "Yes."

Lasse: "He was pushed."

Fortunato: "Yes."

Lasse buried his face in his hands.
Ammonium, Sigur and him.
There were always three of them on the way.
They'd shredded the world.
The three of them had learned everything they could now.
And then, from one day to the next, he was gone.
And no way to get together in the game anymore.

Lasse: "LBI?"

Fortunato: "No, not LBI."

He took a piece of paper and a pencil out of his pocket, scribbled "But LBI" on it and pushed it to Lasse.
Then he shrugged his shoulders as if to apologize to Lasse.

Sigur closed his laptop and took off his headphones: "Done! Let's go to sleep."

Lasse and Fortunato turned to Sigur.
He looked back completely unmoved, a little bored.

"You cool dog," Lasse thought, and his anger waned.

"Yes ... Okay," he said, nodding, "let's go to bed."

He looked at Fortunato: "If you ever run into pictures of May 17 again, please send them to me."

Fortunato: "Your rooms are on the gallery, up the stairs, and to the left.
I'm gonna watch some more TV.
Good night to you."

"Night," Sigur gave back, and they both climbed the stairs.
