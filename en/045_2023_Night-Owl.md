## **2023**** Night-Owl

<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Marwin was still sitting</span> in the meeting room at his table.
In front of him he placed five paper planes and two ships.
He hummed quietly "Don't worry, be happy".

The door handle slowly moved down and the door opened.
A slim young man in prison clothes came in, early 20s, looking a little shy.
He sneaked past Marwin and sat down on the opposite chair.
He had neither hand nor foot cuffs, but bruises were visible.
Both looked at each other.
For some time they did not speak.
Then Marwin reached out his hand to him.

Marwin: "Marwin."

He took Marwin's hand.

Amon: "Night-Owl."

Marwin slightly shocked: "Not the hacker names, not here.
They listen, they record everything."

Amon: "They already know that."

Marwin: "Are you really Night-Owl? <em>The</em> Night-Owl? The security camera hack?"

Amon nodded slowly.

Marwin: "Wow.
I learned so much from you.
How long have you been here?"

Amon: "Two years, ten days, five hours."

Marwin: "Shit.
Then they got you on the same day as me.
Berlin?

Amon nodded again.

Marwin: "Ouch.
Berlin is a big city.
If I had known that Night-Owl was in Berlin ... Wow!"

Amon: "That's what I thought once: wow, Berlin.
But it's not like that anymore ..."

Marwin: "Not anymore?"

Amon: "I don't want this in here anymore, I don't want it out there either.
It's all so fucked up.
They treat you better  if you don't care about anything."

Marwin: "They want to let me out!
I think today.
You too?

Amon: "Forget it.
That's just tricks.
They've let me out three times already.
I signed papers, promised that I wouldn't say anything - until the end of my life, otherwise the end of life would be earlier.
That's exactly what they said.
I just wanted to get out.
I would have signed everything ... And then I stood three times already outside at the bus stop, with all my things and then no bus came but a jeep and they brought me back again.
Now I say everything they want to hear ... It doesn't matter anyway."

Marwin: "You have to keep something.
Something they can't have.
The truth.
You must not lie!
Not even a little.
Otherwise you go over to their side ..."

Amon started to cry.
He put his hands in front of his face: "I can't do this anymore.
I'm going crazy here.
Really crazy.
Of course I'll go to their side when I get out of here."

Marwin took his hand: "Don't lie!
Otherwise you'll really go crazy.
They are crazy because they lie so much."

Tears rolled from Amon's cheeks.
He just let them run, didn't wipe them off.

Marwin: "What did they tell you to do here?
With me?

Amon did not react.

Marwin: "You know this is a game.
They always play games.
Come on, write it down here and cover it with your hand."
He gave him a piece of paper.

Amon looked briefly in the direction of the surveillance camera in front of him and then took the paper.

Amon wrote: "I don't know.
They said you'd gone crazy and didn't want to leave.
And you need someone to talk to."

Marwin read the note and looked at him confused.
Amon shrugged his shoulders.

Amon wrote: "Don't you want to get out?
Home?"

Marwin: "Of course I want to get out of here.
But there's some funny game going on.
They act completely weird.
Probably because of Marlene."

"Marlene?
Marlene ... Farras?" Amon wrote.

Marwin nodded and wrote, "My sister."

Amon: "WAT??
Marlene ... is your sister?
That's awesome.
I once programmed with her at a hackaton.
She's so incredibly fast."

Marwin: "She hacked a TAO computer two years ago.
That's probably why I'm here."

Amon: "She's here too?"

Marwin: "No.
She is free.
Still free.
After two years!
Gorgeous, isn't she?"

Amon: "How do you know that?"

Marwin said loudly: "I know."

Then he took the paper and stuffed it in his mouth.

Marwin swallowed it and grinned: "It's not even that bad for the stomach.
Now they have two or three hours to get it out if they want to read any of it."

Amon had to laugh.
"It's so good to be with someone real," he thought.
"I had almost forgotten what it was like. 

Marwin said at normal volume: "Night-Owl, when we get out of here, we'll do a hack together - no, no, fun ... We'll be good guys again." 

Marwin wrote on the next sheet: "We already did one together.
Your 'Bachelor thesis', that's how you once called it.
But please, don't write my real name."

Amon laughed all over his face.
He wrote: "You?
You were this guy?
Wow.
I always wanted to meet you for real.
That was so awesome in there, in the BND.
They had no chance at all against us.
Not the slightest."

Marwin: "Not the slightest!
Tears came to his eyes.

Amon: "That was so awesome!" 

Amon pushed the paper away and said: "Why do they do such a thing?
Why do they lock us up?
Why are they yelling at us, hitting us on the head with a bat, switch off the light for days, telling us that our family is being murdered?
Why do they seem to let us go, not let us sleep and give us broken computers with fake internet?
Why?
Why are there such assholes?"

Marwin: "They don't know anything about our world.
They don't know the real world.
They don't know anything about what it means to really live according to one's own ideas and not according to what others command or suggest or persuade them to do.
They think it's naive when people want to stand on their own ground.
They think they need friends.
You can not have real friends when you need them.
They don't even understand why this is like this.
They think it's naive if they don't adapt to the system, that they can't do anything anymore, if they don't have a high school diploma, if they don't study, if they have a bad resume which says that you can't rely on them or that they don't work well.
The believe without all this they would die.
They couldn't afford a house or a car, a family if they didn't do a job where someone told them what to do.
Even if they are bosses of big companies, than shareholders tell them what to do.
It's so sick!
They are adults and they think they have to bow."

Amon: "That's really sick!
And we didn't harm anyone.
There's no harm in turning off a few thousand surveillance cameras, or abusing giant advertising displays for a few days to play Tetris.
Do they have to lock us up for that?
Okay, I hacked the liason database at the BND.
That was stupid.
That's when they went wild.
But I had such a fucking anger because so many people around me get money to watch me.
And it would be better for humanity if all the liason people became publicly known.
Also for them.
They get sick after all.
Like Sören.
That's a shit job."

Marwin: "Sören?
Really?
Yes, of course.
You really had the liason database?
Shit.
Why didn't you pass it on?
I would have liked to see that too."

Amon: "I only had an encrypted file, VeraCrypt.
But I had already a small guard program in place on the BND computer, which would have send me the password as soon as one had opened it.
But nobody did, not in two months."

Marwin: "I really would have had a few questions for this database in Berlin ..."

Amon: "I did too ...
But now ... not any more.
You're really not here for one of your own hacks?"

Marwin took the sheet and wrote: "I don't think so.
I didn't get any questions about the things I was involved in."

Amon said out loud: "Shit! They're just shit."

A door opened and a soldier appeared.

Soldier: "Night-Owl, come with me!"

Amon looked at Marwin briefly, rose and followed the soldier.
Marwin closed his eyes and said quietly: "Shit!
That was a trick."
He wiped the tears from his eyes, then stuffed the leaf into his mouth and began to chew.
