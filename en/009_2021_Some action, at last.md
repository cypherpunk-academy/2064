## **2021** 009_2021_Some action, at last!

<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Frederik sat like </span> every morning at his desk on the 6th floor.
The first floor of the headquarters of the Federal Intelligence Service in Berlin, the largest German secret service.
In front of him lay, as always, his snack package, which his wife had made for him, opposite him sat Heinz, absorbed in his newspaper.
Outside the window, a group of about fifty demonstrators shouted slogans like: "Stop the surveillance mania" and "BND to the chain! They wore T-shirts with inscriptions like "I am a torrorist" and "freedom instead of fear." Frederik and Heinz ignored them.

Frederik bit into a sandwich, but then suddenly put it on the table, bent over and looked chewing at his computer monitor: "What's going on there? He pulled his keyboard up to him and typed something.
"Our American colleagues... they must be stung by oats.
Whoa.
Well, finally, some action here!"

Heinz looked at his newspaper and said, "What's up?"

Frederik: "The CIA plans four search actions with twelve police cars, German police cars! Everything today, here in Berlin.
If the press doesn't notice..."

Heinz: "Today?"

Frederik: "Yup." He looked at the clock.
"In half an hour!"

Heinz: "Well, at least they tell us that in advance.
And where?"

Frederik: "Don't say that.
Somewhere in Berlin.
We're supposed to stay out of this.
Probably they just want to scare some activists or hackers again.
According to the motto: We come with German police cars, take you with us, question you and let you run again.
What's the matter with you? Just to show you that we can, so you know who you're dealing with.
And if you say anything about it, your girlfriend will suddenly have an accident.
We'll just show you who's stronger."

Heinz grinned and took his legs off the table: "A little respect doesn't hurt.
Well, I'll pass that on internally, so it doesn't become a mess.
And report to the Police Headquarters, the esteemed colleagues from the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution, State Bureau of Criminal Investigation.
Hmmm... and the Chancellor." He grinned.
"Fun.
Who else needs to know? Do we have the license plates?"

Frederik: "Yup.
I'll send you over..."
