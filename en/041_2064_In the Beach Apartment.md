## **2064** In the beach apartment

<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Sigur and Lasse sat</span> in the living room of the beach apartment in two huge armchairs.
From there they had a 270-degree panoramic view of the sea.
On the other side of the room, there was an oversized television, behind it on the left an open fireplace.

Sigur: "What do you think, when will he come back?"

Lasse: "I don't know.
Maybe he won't come back."

Sigur: "In any case, he sees us on some monitor or hears us through some microphone.
And I haven't found my RFID chip, either."
He was stroking his hair again.
"This is not a good place.
Let's go."

Lasse: "There is something to do here.
Otherwise, Marlene wouldn't have sent us here."
He looked around.

Sigur: "Sure.
There's probably a cloud computer somewhere around here.
And I'm pretty sure there's some super exciting stuff on there.
And now we'll just hack into it and see, for example, what he has to say about the LBI."
He pulled up his eyebrows and smiled posed.
"And since he knows we're hackers, he'll leave us here to do our thing alone."

Lasse: "Mh mh.
He sees us and listens to us.
Absolutely.
But then we can ask him for help if we can't get any further."
He smiled back posed.

Suddenly Sigur looked at Lasse in astonishment.
Then he seemed to think intensely, he closed his eyes.
Then he reached into his backpack, took out his laptop, and put a cloth over his hands as he entered the password.
He started typing on it.
Lasse observed him for a while, Sigur was absorbed in his device, unresponsive, "plugged in," as they called it.
After a while, he also took out his computer, turned it on, entered his password, and went online.

"Pling," said the chat program and showed a message from Sigur.

Sigur: "Finally.
That's what you are! Don't let anything look at the back of your monitor." Lasse folded the screen smoothly to himself.

Sigur: "Next to your left foot under the table is a socket.
I have a wireless plug under my left leg.
Take it inconspicuously, and put it there."
Lasse pretended to tie his shoes and pushed the plug into the box.

Sigur: "Good.
I have contact.
The device tells me ultra-small fluctuations in the power grid, for example, of computer activity, of all the computers that hang here so in the network.
I will now run a port scan on all computers in Caracas and see when something is happening here.
Maybe we'll get something."

Lasse: "Come on, if he has computers here at all, he's probably so paranoid that they're connected to their own network.
He's probably also going out directly to the Internet via satellites."
Sigur sat deep in front of his computer for a while and typed from time to time.
Meanwhile, Lasse is working on his Pond news.

"Got it!" Sigur suddenly wrote, "three computers are right here in the power grid.
Probably in the basement.
Deep in the basement.
One seems to be a Tor Hidden service, probably on a Cubes system.
I'll take a look."

Lasse sent him a file: "Here's Lilly's stuff she's going into Cubes with.
There's nothing for the latest version, but maybe you can use it."

Sigur: "No zero days for the latest version?
Good sign.
I love Cubes.
Hey hey.
He doesn't have the latest version here.
Great.
I'm just trying things out.
Lilly's a sweetheart."

A few minutes later: Sigur didn't look a wink in his armchair and wrote: "YESS!!! I'm in! Super easy.
It had quite good protection, but not the latest version. I always say update, update, update.
Just a minute. Here: The onion address is idtAIrLBI0KJ6gjyro8uTkHa.onion.
What's he got there?
Aha, a shop.
Whoa!
He really is an information broker.
I'm not lying.
Nice and clear.
And here: The search program he was talking about.
You can enter phone numbers, e-mail addresses.
Like XKeyScore from the NSA.
Let's see what it can do.
Give me ... no, not yours! For God's sake.
Edward Snowden's."

Sigur: "Shit, he has only 2% coverage in the motion profile.
How does he do it?
And look how much it costs: Full data $65,000, metadata $38,000.
That's a gift.
Let's see how much coverage Marc Zuckerberg has and what it costs... Ahhh. He's got 99.3%.
Wow. Wow.
Sure thing.
And his files cost $81,000.
Why is he more expensive than Edward?"

Lasse: "Hmmm.
The people who care have more money?"

Sigur: "Never mind.
I'll keep looking. There's undoubtedly more lying around on the computer."
