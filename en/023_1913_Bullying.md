After the speech, in the guest room of a pub.
Wilhelm, Hilde, a driver, and Adolf, a party official.

Wilhelm: "Thank you, Hilde! For your lecture earlier.
I really wouldn't have gone on stage otherwise.
Or at least I wouldn't have said what I said.
It was good talking to comrades like that."

Hilde nods.

Wilhelm: "I haven't spoken as clearly for a long time as I do today.
And the comrades have taken it well, I hear.
It's in the world now.
That's good ... and again not ..."

Hilde: "Again, not either?"

Wilhelm: "Yes, again, not." He closed his eyes.
At that moment, a messenger approached from behind and asked with a soft voice: "Hilde Brandenburg?

Hilde: "That's me."

He handed her a letter and disappeared again.
Hilde opened it hastily and read it.

Hilde: "Oh! Elfi is in distress.
I have to go to Potsdam.
Right away."

Wilhelm: "You can't drive alone.
Not in this position.
It's too dangerous.
And I can't leave now.
"Afterwards are negotiations."

Hilde: "Adolf can accompany me, can't he?"

Wilhelm nodded, and Adolf began to pack his things together.
Wilhelm stood up and walked around the table to embrace Hilde.

Wilhelm: "Take care of yourself!"

Hilde: "I will.
It's not a trip around the world.
You take care of yourself!"

Hilde leaves the room with Adolf.

Wilhelm to the driver: "Now we are alone, Alfons.
It can go that fast, can't it?"

The driver does not look at him, but stands up and leaves the room without giving a sign as to why.
At the same moment, two middle-aged men in grey suits sit next to and opposite Wilhelm and look at him.

Wilhelm was frightened: "What is this?" He takes turns looking at both of them.
His voice trembles slightly.
The two men look back a little indifferently.

Wilhelm: "What do you want from me?"

After a short while, the man sitting opposite him answers: "Nice speech.
Smart thinking.
Pure poison.
It can turn a crowd's head."

A second man with a slightly red face: "You traitor of your country! If it's up to guys like you, no one in Germany will be ready to fight anymore.
And then the Frenchman and the Russian overrun us, and it's over with Germany."

First man: "We will prevent that.
Are you maybe even Russian? Or French? Or English?"

Wilhelm clenches a fist under the table: "I am everything together.
I'm human like you are."

The second man snorts off while the first looks at him sternly.

First man: "We're not half-breeds.
And we won't let you betray our Germany.
We are destroying everything that opposes Germany.
We got people everywhere.
All around you.
Your sitting here alone with us is just a sample of what we can do.
Today you will survive.
Maybe not next time."
He snaps his fingers.

The second man looked at him coldly and grinned, "It would be my pleasure."

First man: "It all depends on how you behave from now on.
The people I work for have little patience.
You're on the fag end.
Think carefully about your next steps."

Then both stand up and leave the room.

Wilhelm puts his face in his hands.
