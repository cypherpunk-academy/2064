## **1915** Germany First!

### SCENE 7
____
A group of officers in a beer restaurant, a lot of smoke, loud conversations everywhere.

First officer: "Wilhelm and Hilde Papenburg, they defile the honor of the German people.
They want to fall into our arms when we raise arms against our cowardly enemies to regain dominance over Europe.
They want to weaken our strength, they make fellowship with our enemies: with the French, with the English, with the Russians.
They are the real enemies on our way to making Germany what it is in essence: a first leading power."

Second officer: "Yes!"

First Officer: "And we must learn that a new era has dawned: machine time.
On the battlefields, the victors will be those who have more efficient machines.
Armored vehicles, armored planes, machine guns.
But also the machines that produce machines, even the machines that farm land, build roads and houses.
Our industry is the decisive factor on our way to world leadership.
And the great people who run the companies: They are leaders of labor units, just as we are leaders of army units."

Second officer: "Hurray for the German economy."

Third officer: "The strongest in the world!"

Fourth officer: "After the Americans.
Still... We've overtaken the English this year.
America is the great danger.
Whoever leads the industry leads the world.
We need robust, growing, and agile companies.
Our companies already have workers working for them around the world.
We don't have to colonize countries, that's yesterday.
We must free countries, open them up so that our companies can let the workers work for them there.
And the people there buy our goods.
This is the new race.
Not the colonization.
And America is one step ahead."

Third officer: "They build the tallest buildings in the world.
The longest railway lines."

First Officer: "We will let the weapons speak, we will change the world order, we will give our companies and our people space everywhere in which they can spread.
And for that, we have to go to the battlefield.
That's why we need respect, total respect.
We'll get it.
And that's why I invited you here today to talk to you about what we can do against those who disturb this path from within our country."

Second officer: "Wilhelm and Hilde Papenburg ..."

First Officer: "...and their corrupt movement.
The Spartacists.
And others.
But first, her.
They poison the hearts of German workers.
They no longer want to work diligently for the cause, they want to work less, they want to have a say, they want to change rules.
They want to own the companies they work for.
Everywhere I look, I see treachery.
Betrayal of the German cause.
Betrayal of the German people.
Of the German entrepreneurs.
The German people should be strong, not weak.
It should prevail against the other countries, not bow.
Socialist utopia will drive us into slavery.
America, England, France, Russia, they respect strength, not weakness.
Austria and Italy respect the strong, not the weak."

Third officer: "Let's get rid of them both.
For good.
No more warnings, no more intimidation.
"They must leave before the disease can spread to other workers."

Second officer: "Yes!"

Fourth officer: "I have her watched around the clock.
We have some of our people in their movement.
There'll always be someone around.
And then we find a plan for how to do it."

First officer: "One for all."

All together: "And all for one!"
