## **2064** Eleven basic ideas

<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Marlene: "The eleven basic ideas</span> have helped us to understand better and better how one can free oneself from the clutches of superior opponents, how one can move and communicate freely, even if there are people who want to prevent this.
Whether these people work for large intelligence agencies, in heavily armed armies, or in huge and wealthy corporations.
There are things stronger than all that.
And that's what the Cypherpunks looked for and tried, so they helped to end the war over 30 years ago.

The basic ideas are like a toolbox.
I'm just gonna hint at each one now.
You can get to know them better in the Academy, where you can also practice them.
You're gonna need them.
You won't get through without it.

I already told you the first thought: encryption, free and open software, distributed computers.
Everything that is indestructible to even the most powerful adversaries.
This has always saved us our personal freedom.
That's the foundation.
Only 50 years ago many people did not understand the great importance of these three things, that without them nothing would work.
That one needs areas in life where one is alone with others, where no one can look in or come in from outside.
Most people took more trouble to learn a language or to drive a car than to learn encryption, to use free software, and to make sure that their personal data wasn't lying around somewhere where someone could steal it.
It was too uncomfortable for many.

Julian Assange once expressed his second thought with the sentence: Dedication wins against wealth.
Devotion wins against wealth.
In my words, I would say that what people carry in their hearts is stronger than any power in the world.
The powerful didn't really care about the cypherpunks back then.
They were annoyed about them, they wanted to stop them, to have them away, but they were not interested in them as people.
That's why they never got rid of her.
They were brutal but half-hearted and therefore slow, inaccurate, and immobile.
The turning point came when every year, more and more young people lived their own ideals and carried them more and more into the world of big companies, governments, and secret services instead of adopting their ideals.
They did not want to bend themselves any more, but to live their ideals also in the companies, everywhere in life as they already did among each other: to meet each other as human beings, to compensate injustices, to live in trust, in community, with a view to the quality of life of each individual human being.

The third thought is the overcoming of opposition in life.
On a large scale, this is the overcoming of nationalism and racism, of people being considered better or worse, more or less worthy depending on which country they come from, what outlook on life, attitude, title, how much money they have, whether they are man or woman.
In detail, it is about recognizing that every person has a good core, really everyone!
At the core, everyone does what they consider to be good and right.
Even if he throws bombs.
He then usually thinks that it is necessary to throw bombs, that there is no other way.
Of course, that's always a mistake in thinking.
And it's racism, of course, if you're against racism.
You can't overcome racism with racism.

The fourth is the free development of one's own initiative.
There were already great attempts in my youth to do this.
For example, the Linux project that all of you know.
Tens of thousands of people work together there and most of them not to earn money, but because they wanted to realize their own ideas.
For that to work, you need reliable and reasonable rules and a strong sense of togetherness.
For example, anyone could start and build their own project at any time, and no one else could talk them into it.
It just wasn't technically possible.
And everyone was allowed to see everything he did from the other, and also to copy all the ideas and plans and programs he wanted without asking.
Today we do this not only with computer programs but everywhere in life: When we build bridges, produce cars or generate electricity, everyone can see how this is done, down to the last detail.
Everybody takes what he needs from it, if he wants to build something himself, he reshapes it and makes it available again to all others, no matter who it is, no matter where in the world.

The fifth is not to judge other people, not to say or think that they are doing something good or bad, that they could do something better, but only to try to understand why they are doing something, why they are thinking or saying something.
The point is to think oneself into others, to see the world from their perspective.
Then something extraordinary often happens: although they sometimes do or say bad things, you feel closer to them, and that makes you calmer even inside.
And the others often notice that, sometimes unconsciously, and also become calmer and get closer.
And then sometimes the whole situation suddenly changes.
I experienced this once with the murderer of my brother.
And also the opposite with my parents, what happens if you don't manage to think yourself into others.

The sixth is that we humans always talk past each other, listen past, and think past each other.
We don't hear what the other guy says, and he doesn't say what he thinks.
I don't mean lying now, but when someone really wants to say what he thinks, then he doesn't say that, but something a little different.
There are a lot of misunderstandings.
What can you do? About what you know in the fable with the four people who all saw the same house, but each only from one side and meet later and talk about it.
You could argue about it now because one saw a door and the other didn't.
And one four windows and another two.
But they don't, they listen to the others and try to figure out how everything fits together.
They try to resolve the contradictions and preserve everything that everyone says.
You have to look at things from different angles if you want to get to know them.

The seventh is the one with which the Cypherpunks movement became known worldwide.
That is the right for everyone to know what governments, today we call administrations, because they no longer govern, what companies, armies, the police and so on are doing.
Everyone has the right to know everything about what concerns them, for example, when they use or consume something.
When you eat an egg, you can experience what has been done to produce it and bring it to you.
Just like when you use electricity when you drive a tram or a car.
And everyone can find out what the administration of their own country does, for example, to ensure security.
But always only then, when it is already done, not before or when it is just done, at the latest a few weeks afterward.
Doing itself should remain free.

We're four short now.
But I feel it gets a little abstract when I just count these.
They're a little different than the first seven, too.
Especially the last two.
Well, let's keep this a little exciting.
You will know them when you are through the first seven thoughts in the Academy."
