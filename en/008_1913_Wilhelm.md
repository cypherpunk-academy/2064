## **1913**** William

### SCENE 1: Berlin 1913
____

The Brandenburg Gate, filled with people, bicycles, horse-drawn cabs, a few uniforms.
/// Aperture /// Side street: three men in uniforms beat a simple young man, insult him, he bleeds out of his nose, buries his head under his arms, another kick in the belly /// A young woman distributing leaflets. All the people she meets take one, begin to read as they go on, concentrated and serious /// Aperture /// A festival meadow, filled with thousands of people with posters, signs, isolated batons.
/// Aperture /// A room behind the stage of a Berlin festival meadow.
You can hear the crowd in the background.
Wilhelm and Hilde.

Hilde runs excitedly back and forth and does not appreciate Wilhelm's gaze.

Hilde says out loud: "It's madness!" She points with both arms towards the stage.
"There are 4,000 comrades out there, hungry, tired from work, scared.
And you just want to get out of here..."

Wilhelm screams: "I DO NOT WANT! I do. Will. Don't. Don't. Get out of here! I want to tell them the truth! It won't work! We can't make it! The opponents are too strong."

Hilde: "You want to make a coward of yourself.
You want to let us down! Now, in this hard time."

Wilhelm: "No, again, I don't want that! But the forces we're up against are so ruthless, so brutal.
If it's up to you, we'll soon have mountains of corpses all over Europe! They want war! All over Europe. With hundreds of thousands dead. And that's what they want!" He covered his face with his hands.

Hilde: "Then take care of it! This is just what you wanted: Fight for peace. Don't run from the fight.
If you see some of our comrades in a wild brawl with an overpowering horde of monarchists and blood everywhere, then you don't go away and say, "It's not working!"

Wilhelm: "Then I will fetch a storm troop of the Spartacists.
I can't do it myself.
But there is no storm troop against the imperialist powers.
They have money, weapons, whole governments, entrepreneurs, the press and now also secret organizations spying for them ... and they murder!"

Hilde: "YOU ARE THE STRUMTRUPPE against the imperialists! The sharpest and most powerful weapon is the word.
That's what you told me.
And the comrades out there called you.
What is a storm troop that doesn't come when you call it?"

Wilhelm folds his arms in front of his chest and closes his eyes.
From outside you can hear "Wilhelm, Wilhelm" shouts getting louder.
He's breathing heavy.
