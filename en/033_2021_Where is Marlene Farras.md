## **2021** Where is Marlene Farras?

<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">In the headquarters of the CIA</span> in Langley/Virginia/USA, a spacious office with a wide window front.
A woman and two men in business attire sit opposite each other at the oval conference table.
In the middle, a coffee service, biscuits, a metal box for mobile phones.

Woman: "Dahab and Hurghada! Egypt."

First man: "Is the information good?"

Frau: "Definitely.
The audio scanners have struck.
We have her voice from a smartphone in Dahab and from one in Hurghada, each less than 10 meters away.
"Only these two times, though, but without a doubt."

A second man dissatisfied: "Only two records?"

Woman: "We know she's there."

First man: "Is there any video?" He was holding a pot against the woman.
"Coffee?"

Woman: "Thank you.
No.
She's careful.
We looked through the local surveillance cameras and the smartphone cameras plus minus two hours and half a mile around.
There was nothing."

Second man: "Not even something suspicious?
A woman in a burka, alone, with a western walk?"

Woman: "Nothing useful.
There's Tor and I2P traffic at both locations.
But not much more than usual.
And nothing that could be assigned."

Second man: "She doesn't go into the Tor network the usual way.
You won't get them there.
That's all you got? That's it? What about Jabber? Ricochet? Pond? Tor Hidden Services?"

Woman: "Jabber doesn't make them.
We don't have a clue to Hidden Services, and we don't know Ricochet and Pond.
They're problematic."

The second man laughs out loud: "You're NSA! After so many years, you can't get into programs written by a school dropout and a Google programmer in their spare time? Why didn't you turn them off long ago?"

The woman closed her eyes and struggled with her anger: "Can we please remain objective? Ricochet and Pond run scattered in the Tor network.
Ricochet has no central server at all and Pond's servers are decentralized.
When we shut down a server, for example, Langley's, we get a WikiLeaks effect: then three new servers pop up somewhere else.
Any popular computer science student can set up a Pond server in 20 minutes.

First man: "And Tor himself? You could turn it off, or at least interrupt it."

The woman moaned, "We can't shut down Tor.
Not for the foreseeable future.
There's too much hanging on."

Second man: "You've lost RAPTOR, you've got hackers in your field communication, so Tor is the safest thing you've got out in the field! You need it yourself.
You got nothing better.
That's the truth of the matter.
And that's shit! This is embarrassing! The NSA needs an open source program."

First man: "Hello, stop! This isn't about us blaming each other.
We're hunting terrorists.
Together!

The second man angry, getting louder: "I need useful information for my work! My mission is to catch Marlene Farras, and I won't let any farting beginners stop me.
Not even when they work at the NSA."

Frau: "No clear names!"

The second man stood up, full of rage: "I've had enough of this.
We'll meet here in person at CIA headquarters! E-mail, phone everything is too insecure for you.
My smartphone is in a metal box, I'm not supposed to use real names.
And I'm fucking at the headquarters of the most powerful intelligence agency in the United States.
Who are we afraid of? A bunch of teenage boys and girls in sloppy sweaters.
We here at the CIA are at the front, we don't rummage around in any nets and push bits from one corner to the other.
We do the real work, the dirty work.
When I tell a CIA field officer to put his smartphone in a tin can, he throws it on the floor and kicks it.
And then he tells me he needs a better one."

The first man grabbed him by the arm, but he got loose.

Second man: "I've really had enough of the pill pill pill we're having here.
I'm about to call Academi.
And they won't list all my problems for half an hour."

"Academi is a mercenary company, not an intelligence agency.
They're sending combat troops, special forces.
You can send them when we know exactly where she is."

Second man: "Nah, Nah.
You're wrong about that.
They're also taking search orders now.
They've got their own hackers now.
They can't always wait to get good information from somewhere.
If I tell them Marlene Farras is in Hurghada or Dahab, it won't take two days, and they'll have them."

First man: "And then she's dead, and some other people with her.
We don't use Academi for hackers! They cause too many problems.
Too unclean.
The situation's heated up enough."

The second man made a movement to respond but then leaned back in his armchair, pinched his lips together and folded his arms.

Frau: "I think that's it for today.
I'd also wish we had more.
The XKeyScore code for the relevant data is here." She pushed two handwritten notes over to the two of them.
