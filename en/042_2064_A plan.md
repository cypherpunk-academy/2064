## **2064** A plan

<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Fortunato sat at a table in </span> a beach caf√© and spooned soup.
Next to him sat Jonny, tanned, muscular torso, in his mid-30s, with Bermuda shirt and straw hat, his face completely in the shade of the hat.
There was a huge cocktail in front of him.

Fortunato: "The two of them are now sitting in my living room at home and hacking into their computers."

Jonny: "Well, then, they're probably just hacking your servers... Super plan!"

Fortunato: "Nope.
No problem. No problem.
They're in the basement, the second basement, secured with a steel safe door.
They can't reach it.
And from there it goes straight up to a TAO satellite.
So not from the outside either.
The TAO set me up.
They're good boys."
He showed him his tablet.
"Look.
It's quiet down there."

Jonny: "Still.
They're both very dangerous.
You better see what they're doing."

Fortunato: "Do you think I waste my time with harmless people?
I don't need non-hazardous people.
You can use them in some state secret service.
These two are young wild horses.
All you have to do is tame them.
I find Sigur particularly interesting.
The way he hacked his first combat robot, unbelievable.
And above all: He is sensitive, he will soon shave his hair and burn his clothes to get the RFID chips out.
He gets into a lot of stress over these things.
That's where we can start..."

Jonny: "What do you want to do?"

Fortunato: "A cyanide implant.
Something that triggers strong feelings: fear, anger.
You've got one of those things inside you, and someone can break the capsule with a satellite remote, and you die.
You can't get it out.
You have to keep checking it's connected, or it'll open.
You'll go crazy.
We need him addicted, controllable.
He'll get it under local anesthesia.
I want him to know everything."

Jonny: "And the other one?"

Fortunato: "Lasse?
We'll separate the two.
He only gets a localization chip but under general anesthesia.
Then he'll be free.
They'll look for each other, you can bet on it.
And Lasse will contact friends.
I'm getting some data for my Darknet collection."

Jonny: "Evil, evil."

Fortunato: "Can you organize all this?
A team with a doctor?
5:45 tomorrow?
At my place.
But the cyanide isn't real.
Dextrose or something.
I don't want to kill him by accident."

Jonny dry: "Okay."
