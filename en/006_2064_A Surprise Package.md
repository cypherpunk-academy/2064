## **2064** A surprise package

<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">"Pling", said the communicator</span> of Lilly, and shortly afterwards, "pling, pling", also those of the two boys.
Sometime after the end of the game, all players received the results for that day.
TRON almost always made the answers completely automatic. Sometimes, however, the team controlling TRON intervened.

Lasse: "And? What did you get, Lilly?"

Lilly: "First you.
What did you get?"

Sigur looked gloomily and said, "We've been blown by your hack.
Thank you." He nodded towards Lilly.
"NSA is after us now, and we must escape.
Your Marie is really super fast."

Lilly: "Oh, exciting ... new time ... Well then: fake passports, new laptops, new look and off you go ... You can score a lot of points.
Do you have any contact points the NSA doesn't know? Can you get computers that can't be traced back to you?"

Lasse ironically: "Thanks for the tips, Lilly! And also zero experience points today.
Zero." He clenched his fist.
"What did you get?" He turned to Lilly.

Lilly: "Your computers gave me 20 points, excellent.
And I'm an unofficial associate at Marie now so I can do a lot of things.
And, wow, I got a surprise package..."

Surprise packages were sometimes available for special events, mostly when players had accomplished a mission that had taken place in the real world.

Lasse: "Really? Pack it up.
What's in it?"

Lilly held her communicator towards the 3D printer and a minute later a small box appeared there.
Lilly took it and opened it.

Lilly: "Wow.
Hello.
Strong.
Here's a picture of Marlene Farras!
Yeah, sure, because of the NSA's Internet vulnerabilities.
That was their hack in reality.
That was 2021.
Then she pulled out the whole database, complete, all at once, a madness, and then she was on the run from the secret services all over the world like you are now, just a little more blatant."
She turned the card over.
"Ohh!!! Fuck! I don't believe this..."

Would you like to have a cocoa with me? Then call me.

Marlene

Lilly raised her arms: "JUUUHHHUUU!!!! Awesome!
Marlene Farras, for real! Marlene Farras, for real! I don't believe this.
Your personal address.
Look here, your personal PGP code."

Lilly had jumped from the table and was dancing around the room.
Lasse and Sigur looked at each other.

Lasse: "Marlene Farras? Is she still alive?"

Sigur: "If she can drink cocoa, maybe..."
